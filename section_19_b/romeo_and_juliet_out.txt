45		
46		THE PROLOGUE
47		
48		[Enter Chorus.]
49		
50		Chor.
51		Two households, both alike in dignity,
52		  In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
53		From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
54		  Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
55		From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
56		  A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
57		Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
58		  Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
59		The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
60		  And the continuance of their parents' rage,
61		Which but their children's end naught could remove,
62		  Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
63		The which, if you with patient ears attend,
64		What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
65		
66		
67		ACT I.
68		
69		Scene I. A public place.
70		
71		[Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.]
72		
73		Sampson.
74		Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
75		
76		Gregory.
77		No, for then we should be colliers.
78		
79		Sampson.
80		I mean, an we be in choler we'll draw.
81		
82		Gregory.
83		Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
84		
85		Sampson.
86		I strike quickly, being moved.
87		
88		Gregory.
89		But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
90		
91		Sampson.
92		A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
93		
94		Gregory.
95		To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
96		therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
97		
98		Sampson.
99		A dog of that house shall move me to stand:
100		I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
101		
102		Gregory.
103		That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
104		wall.
105		
106		Sampson.
107		True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
108		are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague's men
109		from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
110		
111		Gregory.
112		The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
113		
114		Sampson.
115		'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant:
116		when I have fought with the men I will be cruel with the maids,
117		I will cut off their heads.
118		
119		Gregory.
120		The heads of the maids?
121		
122		Sampson.
123		Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
124		take it in what sense thou wilt.
125		
126		Gregory.
127		They must take it in sense that feel it.
128		
129		Sampson.
130		Me they shall feel while I am able to stand:
131		and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
132		
133		Gregory.
134		'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst,
135		thou hadst been poor-John.--Draw thy tool;
136		Here comes two of the house of Montagues.
137		
138		Sampson.
139		My naked weapon is out: quarrel! I will back thee.
140		
141		Gregory.
142		How! turn thy back and run?
143		
144		Sampson.
145		Fear me not.
146		
147		Gregory.
148		No, marry; I fear thee!
149		
150		Sampson.
151		Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
152		
153		Gregory.
154		I will frown as I pass by; and let them take it as they
155		list.
156		
157		Sampson.
158		Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
159		disgrace to them if they bear it.
160		
161		[Enter Abraham and Balthasar.]
162		
163		Abraham.
164		Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
165		
166		Sampson.
167		I do bite my thumb, sir.
168		
169		Abraham.
170		Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
171		
172		Sampson.
173		Is the law of our side if I say ay?
174		
175		Gregory.
176		No.
177		
178		Sampson.
179		No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
180		thumb, sir.
181		
182		Gregory.
183		Do you quarrel, sir?
184		
185		Abraham.
186		Quarrel, sir! no, sir.
187		
188		Sampson.
189		But if you do, sir, am for you: I serve as good a man as
190		you.
191		
192		Abraham.
193		No better.
194		
195		Sampson.
196		Well, sir.
197		
198		Gregory.
199		Say better; here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
200		
201		Sampson.
202		Yes, better, sir.
203		
204		Abraham.
205		You lie.
206		
207		Sampson.
208		Draw, if you be men.--Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
209		
210		[They fight.]
211		
212		[Enter Benvolio.]
213		
214		Benvolio.
215		Part, fools! put up your swords; you know not what you do.
216		[Beats down their swords.]
217		
218		[Enter Tybalt.]
219		
220		Tybalt.
221		What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
222		Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.
223		
224		Benvolio.
225		I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
226		Or manage it to part these men with me.
227		
228		Tybalt.
229		What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word
230		As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
231		Have at thee, coward!
232		
233		[They fight.]
234		
235		[Enter several of both Houses, who join the fray; then enter
236		Citizens with clubs.]
237		
238		1 Citizen.
239		Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
240		Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
241		
242		[Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.]
243		
244		Capulet.
245		What noise is this?--Give me my long sword, ho!
246		
247		Lady Capulet.
248		A crutch, a crutch!--Why call you for a sword?
249		
250		Capulet.
251		My sword, I say!--Old Montague is come,
252		And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
253		
254		[Enter Montague and his Lady  Montague.]
255		
256		Montague.
257		Thou villain Capulet!-- Hold me not, let me go.
258		
259		Lady  Montague.
260		Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
261		
262		[Enter Prince, with Attendants.]
263		
264		Prince.
265		Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
266		Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
267		Will they not hear?--What, ho! you men, you beasts,
268		That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
269		With purple fountains issuing from your veins,--
270		On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
271		Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground
272		And hear the sentence of your moved prince.--
273		Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
274		By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
275		Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets;
276		And made Verona's ancient citizens
277		Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
278		To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
279		Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
280		If ever you disturb our streets again,
281		Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
282		For this time, all the rest depart away:--
283		You, Capulet, shall go along with me;--
284		And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
285		To know our farther pleasure in this case,
286		To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.--
287		Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
288		
289		[Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,
290		Citizens, and Servants.]
291		
292		Montague.
293		Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?--
294		Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
295		
296		Benvolio.
297		Here were the servants of your adversary
298		And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
299		I drew to part them: in the instant came
300		The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
301		Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
302		He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
303		Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn:
304		While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
305		Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
306		Till the prince came, who parted either part.
307		
308		Lady Montague.
309		O, where is Romeo?--saw you him to-day?--
310		Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
311		
312		Benvolio.
313		Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
314		Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
315		A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
316		Where,--underneath the grove of sycamore
317		That westward rooteth from the city's side,--
318		So early walking did I see your son:
319		Towards him I made; but he was ware of me,
320		And stole into the covert of the wood:
321		I, measuring his affections by my own,--
322		That most are busied when they're most alone,--
323		Pursu'd my humour, not pursuing his,
324		And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
325		
326		Montague.
327		Many a morning hath he there been seen,
328		With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
329		Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs:
330		But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
331		Should in the farthest east begin to draw
332		The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
333		Away from light steals home my heavy son,
334		And private in his chamber pens himself;
335		Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out
336		And makes himself an artificial night:
337		Black and portentous must this humour prove,
338		Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
339		
340		Benvolio.
341		My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
342		
343		Montague.
344		I neither know it nor can learn of him.
345		
346		Benvolio.
347		Have you importun'd him by any means?
348		
349		Montague.
350		Both by myself and many other friends;
351		But he, his own affections' counsellor,
352		Is to himself,--I will not say how true,--
353		But to himself so secret and so close,
354		So far from sounding and discovery,
355		As is the bud bit with an envious worm
356		Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
357		Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
358		Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
359		We would as willingly give cure as know.
360		
361		Benvolio.
362		See, where he comes: so please you step aside;
363		I'll know his grievance or be much denied.
364		
365		Montague.
366		I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
367		To hear true shrift.--Come, madam, let's away,
368		
369		[Exeunt Montague and Lady.]
370		
371		[Enter Romeo.]
372		
373		Benvolio.
374		Good morrow, cousin.
375		
376		Romeo.
377		Is the day so young?
378		
379		Benvolio.
380		But new struck nine.
381		
382		Romeo.
383		Ay me! sad hours seem long.
384		Was that my father that went hence so fast?
385		
386		Benvolio.
387		It was.--What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
388		
389		Romeo.
390		Not having that which, having, makes them short.
391		
392		Benvolio.
393		In love?
394		
395		Romeo.
396		Out,--
397		
398		Benvolio.
399		Of love?
400		
401		Romeo.
402		Out of her favour where I am in love.
403		
404		Benvolio.
405		Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
406		Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
407		
408		Romeo.
409		Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
410		Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!--
411		Where shall we dine?--O me!--What fray was here?
412		Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
413		Here's much to do with hate, but more with love:--
414		Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
415		O anything, of nothing first create!
416		O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
417		Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
418		Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
419		Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!--
420		This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
421		Dost thou not laugh?
422		
423		Benvolio.
424		No, coz, I rather weep.
425		
426		Romeo.
427		Good heart, at what?
428		
429		Benvolio.
430		At thy good heart's oppression.
431		
432		Romeo.
433		Why, such is love's transgression.--
434		Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast;
435		Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
436		With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
437		Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
438		Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
439		Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
440		Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
441		What is it else? a madness most discreet,
442		A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.--
443		Farewell, my coz.
444		
445		[Going.]
446		
447		Benvolio.
448		Soft! I will go along:
449		An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
450		
451		Romeo.
452		Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
453		This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
454		
455		Benvolio.
456		Tell me in sadness who is that you love?
457		
458		Romeo.
459		What, shall I groan and tell thee?
460		
461		Benvolio.
462		Groan!  why, no;
463		But sadly tell me who.
464		
465		Romeo.
466		Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,--
467		Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!--
468		In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
469		
470		Benvolio.
471		I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
472		
473		Romeo.
474		A right good markman!--And she's fair I love.
475		
476		Benvolio.
477		A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
478		
479		Romeo.
480		Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
481		With Cupid's arrow,--she hath Dian's wit;
482		And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
483		From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
484		She will not stay the siege of loving terms
485		Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
486		Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
487		O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
488		That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
489		
490		Benvolio.
491		Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
492		
493		Romeo.
494		She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
495		For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
496		Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
497		She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,
498		To merit bliss by making me despair:
499		She hath forsworn to love; and in that vow
500		Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
501		
502		Benvolio.
503		Be rul'd by me, forget to think of her.
504		
505		Romeo.
506		O, teach me how I should forget to think.
507		
508		Benvolio.
509		By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
510		Examine other beauties.
511		
512		Romeo.
513		'Tis the way
514		To call hers, exquisite, in question more:
515		These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
516		Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;
517		He that is strucken blind cannot forget
518		The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
519		Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
520		What doth her beauty serve but as a note
521		Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
522		Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
523		
524		Benvolio.
525		I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
526		
527		[Exeunt.]
528		
529		
530		Scene II. A Street.
531		
532		[Enter Capulet, Paris, and Servant.]
533		
534		Capulet.
535		But Montague is bound as well as I,
536		In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
537		For men so old as we to keep the peace.
538		
539		Paris.
540		Of honourable reckoning are you both;
541		And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
542		But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
543		
544		Capulet.
545		But saying o'er what I have said before:
546		My child is yet a stranger in the world,
547		She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
548		Let two more summers wither in their pride
549		Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
550		
551		Paris.
552		Younger than she are happy mothers made.
553		
554		Capulet.
555		And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
556		The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,--
557		She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
558		But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
559		My will to her consent is but a part;
560		An she agree, within her scope of choice
561		Lies my consent and fair according voice.
562		This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
563		Whereto I have invited many a guest,
564		Such as I love; and you among the store,
565		One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
566		At my poor house look to behold this night
567		Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
568		Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
569		When well apparell'd April on the heel
570		Of limping winter treads, even such delight
571		Among fresh female buds shall you this night
572		Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
573		And like her most whose merit most shall be:
574		Which, among view of many, mine, being one,
575		May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
576		Come, go with me.--Go, sirrah, trudge about
577		Through fair Verona; find those persons out
578		Whose names are written there, [gives a paper] and to them say,
579		My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
580		
581		[Exeunt Capulet and Paris].
582		
583		Servant.Find them out whose names are written here!
584		It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with
585		his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
586		his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
587		sent to find those persons whose names are here writ,
588		and can never find what names the writing person
589		hath here writ. I must to the learned:--in good time!
590		
591		[Enter Benvolio and Romeo.]
592		
593		Benvolio.
594		Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
595		  One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
596		Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
597		  One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
598		Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
599		And the rank poison of the old will die.
600		
601		Romeo.
602		Your plantain-leaf is excellent for that.
603		
604		Benvolio.
605		For what, I pray thee?
606		
607		Romeo.
608		For your broken shin.
609		
610		Benvolio.
611		Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
612		
613		Romeo.
614		Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
615		Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
616		Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
617		
618		Servant.
619		God gi' go-den.--I pray, sir, can you read?
620		
621		Romeo.
622		Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
623		
624		Servant.
625		Perhaps you have learned it without book:
626		but I pray, can you read anything you see?
627		
628		Romeo.
629		Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
630		
631		Servant.
632		Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
633		
634		Romeo.
635		Stay, fellow; I can read.  [Reads.]
636		'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
637		County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters; the
638		lady widow of Vitruvio; Signior Placentio and
639		his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother
640		Valentine; mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and
641		daughters; my fair niece Rosaline; Livia; Signior
642		Valentio and his cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the
643		lively Helena.'
644		A fair assembly. [Gives back the paper]: whither should they
645		come?
646		
647		Servant.
648		Up.
649		
650		Romeo.
651		Whither?
652		
653		Servant.
654		To supper; to our house.
655		
656		Romeo.
657		Whose house?
658		
659		Servant.
660		My master's.
661		
662		Romeo.
663		Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
664		
665		Servant.
666		Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the great
667		rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues,
668		I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.  Rest you merry!
669		
670		[Exit.]
671		
672		Benvolio.
673		At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
674		Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
675		With all the admired beauties of Verona.
676		Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
677		Compare her face with some that I shall show,
678		And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
679		
680		Romeo.
681		When the devout religion of mine eye
682		  Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
683		And these,--who, often drown'd, could never die,--
684		  Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
685		One fairer than my love? the all-seeing sun
686		Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
687		
688		Benvolio.
689		Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
690		Herself pois'd with herself in either eye:
691		But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
692		Your lady's love against some other maid
693		That I will show you shining at this feast,
694		And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
695		
696		Romeo.
697		I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
698		But to rejoice in splendour of my own.
699

703		Scene III. Room in Capulet's House.
704		
705		[Enter Lady Capulet, and Nurse.]
706		
707		Lady Capulet.
708		Nurse, where's my daughter?  call her forth to me.
709		
710		Nurse.
711		Now, by my maidenhea,--at twelve year old,--
712		I bade her come.--What, lamb! what ladybird!--
713		God forbid!--where's this girl?--what, Juliet!
714		
715		[Enter Juliet.]
716		
717		Juliet.
718		How now, who calls?
719		
720		Nurse.
721		Your mother.
722		
723		Juliet.
724		Madam, I am here.  What is your will?
725		
726		Lady Capulet.
727		This is the matter,--Nurse, give leave awhile,
728		We must talk in secret: nurse, come back again;
729		I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
730		Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
731		
732		Nurse.
733		Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
734		
735		Lady Capulet.
736		She's not fourteen.
737		
738		Nurse.
739		I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
740		And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,--
741		She is not fourteen. How long is it now
742		To Lammas-tide?
743		
744		Lady Capulet.
745		A fortnight and odd days.
746		
747		Nurse.
748		Even or odd, of all days in the year,
749		Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
750		Susan and she,--God rest all Christian souls!--
751		Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
752		She was too good for me:--but, as I said,
753		On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
754		That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
755		'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
756		And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it--,
757		Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
758		For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
759		Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
760		My lord and you were then at Mantua:
761		Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
762		When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
763		Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
764		To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!
765		Shake, quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
766		To bid me trudge.
767		And since that time it is eleven years;
768		For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood
769		She could have run and waddled all about;
770		For even the day before, she broke her brow:
771		And then my husband,--God be with his soul!
772		'A was a merry man,--took up the child:
773		'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
774		Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
775		Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
776		The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay:'
777		To see now how a jest shall come about!
778		I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
779		I never should forget it; 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
780		And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
781		
782		Lady Capulet.
783		Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.
784		
785		Nurse.
786		Yes, madam;--yet I cannot choose but laugh,
787		To think it should leave crying, and say 'Ay:'
788		And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
789		A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
790		A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly.
791		'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
792		Thou wilt fall backward when thou com'st to age;
793		Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
794		
795		Juliet.
796		And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
797		
798		Nurse.
799		Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
800		Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd:
801		An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
802		
803		Lady Capulet.
804		Marry, that marry is the very theme
805		I came to talk of.--Tell me, daughter Juliet,
806		How stands your disposition to be married?
807		
808		Juliet.
809		It is an honour that I dream not of.
810		
811		Nurse.
812		An honour!--were not I thine only nurse,
813		I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
814		
815		Lady Capulet.
816		Well, think of marriage now: younger than you,
817		Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
818		Are made already mothers: by my count
819		I was your mother much upon these years
820		That you are now a maid.  Thus, then, in brief;--
821		The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
822		
823		Nurse.
824		A man, young lady! lady, such a man
825		As all the world--why he's a man of wax.
826		
827		Lady Capulet.
828		Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
829		
830		Nurse.
831		Nay, he's a flower, in faith, a very flower.
832		
833		Lady Capulet.
834		What say you? can you love the gentleman?
835		This night you shall behold him at our feast;
836		Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
837		And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
838		Examine every married lineament,
839		And see how one another lends content;
840		And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
841		Find written in the margent of his eyes.
842		This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
843		To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
844		The fish lives in the sea; and 'tis much pride
845		For fair without the fair within to hide:
846		That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
847		That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
848		So shall you share all that he doth possess,
849		By having him, making yourself no less.
850		
851		Nurse.
852		No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men
853		
854		Lady Capulet.
855		Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
856		
857		Juliet.
858		I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
859		But no more deep will I endart mine eye
860		Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
861		
862		[Enter a Servant.]
863		
864		Servant.
865		Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
866		called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed
867		in the pantry, and everything in extremity. I must
868		hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
869		
870		Lady Capulet.
871		We follow thee. [Exit Servant.]--
872		Juliet, the county stays.
873		
874		Nurse.
875		Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
876		
877		[Exeunt.]
878		
879		
880		Scene IV. A Street.
881		
882		[Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;
883		Torch-bearers, and others.]
884		
885		Romeo.
886		What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
887		Or shall we on without apology?
888		
889		Benvolio.
890		The date is out of such prolixity:
891		We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
892		Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
893		Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
894		Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
895		After the prompter, for our entrance:
896		But, let them measure us by what they will,
897		We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
898		
899		Romeo.
900		Give me a torch,--I am not for this ambling;
901		Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
902		
903		Mercutio.
904		Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
905		
906		Romeo.
907		Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes,
908		With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
909		So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
910		
911		Mercutio.
912		You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
913		And soar with them above a common bound.
914		
915		Romeo.
916		I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
917		To soar with his light feathers; and so bound,
918		I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
919		Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
920		
921		Mercutio.
922		And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
923		Too great oppression for a tender thing.
924		
925		Romeo.
926		Is love a tender thing?  it is too rough,
927		Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.
928		
929		Mercutio.
930		If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
931		Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.--
932		Give me a case to put my visage in: [Putting on a mask.]
933		A visard for a visard!  what care I
934		What curious eye doth quote deformities?
935		Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.
936		
937		Benvolio.
938		Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
939		But every man betake him to his legs.
940		
941		Romeo.
942		A torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,
943		Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
944		For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,--
945		I'll be a candle-holder and look on,--
946		The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
947		
948		Mercutio.
949		Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
950		If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
951		Of this--sir-reverence--love, wherein thou stick'st
952		Up to the ears.--Come, we burn daylight, ho.
953		
954		Romeo.
955		Nay, that's not so.
956		
957		Mercutio.
958		I mean, sir, in delay
959		We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
960		Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
961		Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
962		
963		Romeo.
964		And we mean well, in going to this mask;
965		But 'tis no wit to go.
966		
967		Mercutio.
968		Why, may one ask?
969		
970		Romeo.
971		I dreamt a dream to-night.
972		
973		Mercutio.
974		And so did I.
975		
976		Romeo.
977		Well, what was yours?
978		
979		Mercutio.
980		That dreamers often lie.
981		
982		Romeo.
983		In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
984		
985		Mercutio.
986		O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
987		She is the fairies' midwife; and she comes
988		In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
989		On the fore-finger of an alderman,
990		Drawn with a team of little atomies
991		Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep:
992		Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs;
993		The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
994		The traces, of the smallest spider's web;
995		The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams;
996		Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
997		Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
998		Not half so big as a round little worm
999		Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid:
1000		Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
1001		Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
1002		Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
1003		And in this state she gallops night by night
1004		Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
1005		O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight;
1006		O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
1007		O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,--
1008		Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
1009		Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
1010		Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
1011		And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
1012		And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,
1013		Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
1014		Then dreams he of another benefice:
1015		Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
1016		And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
1017		Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
1018		Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
1019		Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
1020		And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
1021		And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
1022		That plats the manes of horses in the night;
1023		And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
1024		Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
1025		This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
1026		That presses them, and learns them first to bear,
1027		Making them women of good carriage:
1028		This is she,--
1029		
1030		Romeo.
1031		Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace,
1032		Thou talk'st of nothing.
1033		
1034		Mercutio.
1035		True, I talk of dreams,
1036		Which are the children of an idle brain,
1037		Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
1038		Which is as thin of substance as the air,
1039		And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
1040		Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
1041		And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
1042		Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
1043		
1044		Benvolio.
1045		This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:
1046		Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
1047		
1048		Romeo.
1049		I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
1050		Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
1051		Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
1052		With this night's revels; and expire the term
1053		Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
1054		By some vile forfeit of untimely death:
1055		But He that hath the steerage of my course
1056		Direct my sail!--On, lusty gentlemen!
1057		
1058		Benvolio.
1059		Strike, drum.
1060		
1061		[Exeunt.]

1067		
1068		1 Servant.
1069		Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
1070		he shift a trencher!  he scrape a trencher!
1071		
1072		2 Servant.
1073		When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
1074		hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
1075		
1076		1 Servant.
1077		Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look
1078		to the plate:--good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as
1079		thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.--
1080		Antony! and Potpan!
1081		
1082		2 Servant.
1083		Ay, boy, ready.
1084		
1085		1 Servant.
1086		You are looked for and called for, asked for
1087		and sought for in the great chamber.
1088		
1089		2 Servant.
1090		We cannot be here and there too.--Cheerly, boys;
1091		be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
1092		
1093		[They retire behind.]
1094		
1095		[Enter Capulet, &c. with the Guests the Maskers.]
1096		
1097		Capulet.
1098		Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
1099		Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.--
1100		Ah ha, my mistresses!  which of you all
1101		Will now deny to dance?  she that makes dainty, she,
1102		I'll swear hath corns; am I come near you now?
1103		Welcome, gentlemen!  I have seen the day
1104		That I have worn a visard; and could tell
1105		A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
1106		Such as would please;--'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
1107		You are welcome, gentlemen!--Come, musicians, play.
1108		A hall--a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.--
1109		[Music plays, and they dance.]
1110		More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
1111		And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.--
1112		Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
1113		Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
1114		For you and I are past our dancing days;
1115		How long is't now since last yourself and I
1116		Were in a mask?
1117		
1118		2 Capulet.
1119		By'r Lady, thirty years.
1120		
1121		Capulet.
1122		What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
1123		'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
1124		Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
1125		Some five-and-twenty years; and then we mask'd.
1126		
1127		2 Capulet.
1128		'Tis more, 'tis more: his son is elder, sir;
1129		His son is thirty.
1130		
1131		Capulet.
1132		Will you tell me that?
1133		His son was but a ward two years ago.
1134		
1135		Romeo.
1136		What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand
1137		Of yonder knight?
1138		
1139		Servant.
1140		I know not, sir.
1141		
1142		Romeo.
1143		O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
1144		It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
1145		Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear;
1146		Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
1147		So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
1148		As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
1149		The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
1150		And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
1151		Did my heart love till now?  forswear it, sight!
1152		For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
1153		
1154		Tybalt.
1155		This, by his voice, should be a Montague.--
1156		Fetch me my rapier, boy:--what, dares the slave
1157		Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
1158		To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
1159		Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
1160		To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
1161		
1162		Capulet.
1163		Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
1164		
1165		Tybalt.
1166		Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
1167		A villain, that is hither come in spite,
1168		To scorn at our solemnity this night.
1169		
1170		Capulet.
1171		Young Romeo, is it?
1172		
1173		Tybalt.
1174		'Tis he, that villain, Romeo.
1175		
1176		Capulet.
1177		Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
1178		He bears him like a portly gentleman;
1179		And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
1180		To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
1181		I would not for the wealth of all the town
1182		Here in my house do him disparagement:
1183		Therefore be patient, take no note of him,--
1184		It is my will; the which if thou respect,
1185		Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
1186		An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
1187		
1188		Tybalt.
1189		It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
1190		I'll not endure him.
1191		
1192		Capulet.
1193		He shall be endur'd:
1194		What, goodman boy!--I say he shall;--go to;
1195		Am I the master here, or you?  go to.
1196		You'll not endure him!--God shall mend my soul,
1197		You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
1198		You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
1199		
1200		Tybalt.
1201		Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
1202		
1203		Capulet.
1204		Go to, go to!
1205		You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?--
1206		This trick may chance to scathe you,--I know what:
1207		You must contrary me!  marry, 'tis time.--
1208		Well said, my hearts!--You are a princox; go:
1209		Be quiet, or--More light, more light!--For shame!
1210		I'll make you quiet. What!--cheerly, my hearts.
1211		
1212		Tybalt.
1213		Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
1214		Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
1215		I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,
1216		Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.
1217		
1218		[Exit.]
1219		
1220		Romeo.
1221		[To Juliet.] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
1222		  This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this,--
1223		My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
1224		  To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
1225		
1226		Juliet.
1227		Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
1228		  Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
1229		For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
1230		  And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
1231		
1232		Romeo.
1233		Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
1234		
1235		Juliet.
1236		Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
1237		
1238		Romeo.
1239		O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
1240		They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
1241		
1242		Juliet.
1243		Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
1244		
1245		Romeo.
1246		Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
1247		Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.
1248		[Kissing her.]
1249		
1250		Juliet.
1251		Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
1252		
1253		Romeo.
1254		Sin from my lips?  O trespass sweetly urg'd!
1255		Give me my sin again.
1256		
1257		Juliet.
1258		You kiss by the book.
1259		
1260		Nurse.
1261		Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
1262		
1263		Romeo.
1264		What is her mother?
1265		
1266		Nurse.
1267		Marry, bachelor,
1268		Her mother is the lady of the house.
1269		And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous:
1270		I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal;
1271		I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
1272		Shall have the chinks.
1273		
1274		Romeo.
1275		Is she a Capulet?
1276		O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
1277		
1278		Benvolio.
1279		Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
1280		
1281		Romeo.
1282		Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
1283		
1284		Capulet.
1285		Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
1286		We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.--
1287		Is it e'en so?  why then, I thank you all;
1288		I thank you, honest gentlemen; good-night.--
1289		More torches here!--Come on then, let's to bed.
1290		Ah, sirrah [to 2 Capulet], by my fay, it waxes late;
1291		I'll to my rest.
1292		
1293		[Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse.]
1294		
1295		Juliet.
1296		Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
1297		
1298		Nurse.
1299		The son and heir of old Tiberio.
1300		
1301		Juliet.
1302		What's he that now is going out of door?
1303		
1304		Nurse.
1305		Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
1306		
1307		Juliet.
1308		What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
1309		
1310		Nurse.
1311		I know not.
1312		
1313		Juliet.
1314		Go ask his name: if he be married,
1315		My grave is like to be my wedding-bed.
1316		
1317		Nurse.
1318		His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
1319		The only son of your great enemy.
1320		
1321		Juliet.
1322		My only love sprung from my only hate!
1323		Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1324		Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
1325		That I must love a loathed enemy.
1326		
1327		Nurse.
1328		What's this? What's this?
1329		
1330		Juliet.
1331		A rhyme I learn'd even now
1332		Of one I danc'd withal.
1333		
1334		[One calls within, 'Juliet.']
1335		
1336		Nurse.
1337		Anon, anon!
1338		Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
1339		
1340		[Exeunt.]
1341		
1342		
1343		[Enter Chorus.]
1344		
1345		Chorus.
1346		Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
1347		  And young affection gapes to be his heir;
1348		That fair for which love groan'd for, and would die,
1349		  With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
1350		Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
1351		  Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
1352		But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
1353		  And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
1354		Being held a foe, he may not have access
1355		  To breathe such vows as lovers us'd to swear;
1356		And she as much in love, her means much less
1357		  To meet her new beloved anywhere:
1358		But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
1359		  Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
1360		
1361		[Exit.]
1362		
1363		
1364		ACT II.
1365		
1366		Scene I. An open place adjoining Capulet's Garden.
1367		
1368		[Enter Romeo.]
1369		
1370		Romeo.
1371		Can I go forward when my heart is here?
1372		Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
1373		
1374		[He climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]
1375		
1376		[Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.]
1377		
1378		Benvolio.
1379		Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
1380		
1381		Mercutio.
1382		He is wise;
1383		And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
1384		
1385		Benvolio.
1386		He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
1387		Call, good Mercutio.
1388		
1389		Mercutio.
1390		Nay, I'll conjure too.--
1391		Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
1392		Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
1393		Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
1394		Cry but 'Ah me!' pronounce but Love and dove;
1395		Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
1396		One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
1397		Young auburn Cupid, he that shot so trim
1398		When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid!--
1399		He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
1400		The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.--
1401		I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
1402		By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
1403		By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
1404		And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
1405		That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
1406		
1407		Benvolio.
1408		An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
1409		
1410		Mercutio.
1411		This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
1412		To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle,
1413		Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
1414		Till she had laid it, and conjur'd it down;
1415		That were some spite: my invocation
1416		Is fair and honest, and, in his mistress' name,
1417		I conjure only but to raise up him.
1418		
1419		Benvolio.
1420		Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
1421		To be consorted with the humorous night:
1422		Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.
1423		
1424		Mercutio.
1425		If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
1426		Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
1427		And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
1428		As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.--
1429		Romeo, good night.--I'll to my truckle-bed;
1430		This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
1431		Come, shall we go?
1432		
1433		Benvolio.
1434		Go then; for 'tis in vain
1435		To seek him here that means not to be found.
1436		
1437		[Exeunt.]
1438		
1439		
1440		Scene II. Capulet's Garden.
1441		
1442		[Enter Romeo.]
1443		
1444		Romeo.
1445		He jests at scars that never felt a wound.--
1446		[Juliet appears above at a window.]
1447		But soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
1448		It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!--
1449		Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
1450		Who is already sick and pale with grief,
1451		That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
1452		Be not her maid, since she is envious;
1453		Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
1454		And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.--
1455		It is my lady; O, it is my love!
1456		O, that she knew she were!--
1457		She speaks, yet she says nothing: what of that?
1458		Her eye discourses, I will answer it.--
1459		I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
1460		Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
1461		Having some business, do entreat her eyes
1462		To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1463		What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1464		The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
1465		As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
1466		Would through the airy region stream so bright
1467		That birds would sing and think it were not night.--
1468		See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
1469		O that I were a glove upon that hand,
1470		That I might touch that cheek!
1471		
1472		Juliet.
1473		Ah me!
1474		
1475		Romeo.
1476		She speaks:--
1477		O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
1478		As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
1479		As is a winged messenger of heaven
1480		Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
1481		Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1482		When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
1483		And sails upon the bosom of the air.
1484		
1485		Juliet.
1486		O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
1487		Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
1488		Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1489		And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
1490		
1491		Romeo.
1492		[Aside.] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
1493		
1494		Juliet.
1495		'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;--
1496		Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1497		What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
1498		Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
1499		Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
1500		What's in a name? that which we call a rose
1501		By any other name would smell as sweet;
1502		So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
1503		Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1504		Without that title:--Romeo, doff thy name;
1505		And for that name, which is no part of thee,
1506		Take all myself.
1507		
1508		Romeo.
1509		I take thee at thy word:
1510		Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
1511		Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
1512		
1513		Juliet.
1514		What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
1515		So stumblest on my counsel?
1516		
1517		Romeo.
1518		By a name
1519		I know not how to tell thee who I am:
1520		My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
1521		Because it is an enemy to thee.
1522		Had I it written, I would tear the word.
1523		
1524		Juliet.
1525		My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
1526		Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound;
1527		Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
1528		
1529		Romeo.
1530		Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
1531		
1532		Juliet.
1533		How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1534		The orchard walls are high and hard to climb;
1535		And the place death, considering who thou art,
1536		If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
1537		
1538		Romeo.
1539		With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
1540		For stony limits cannot hold love out:
1541		And what love can do, that dares love attempt;
1542		Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
1543		
1544		Juliet.
1545		If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
1546		
1547		Romeo.
1548		Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1549		Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
1550		And I am proof against their enmity.
1551		
1552		Juliet.
1553		I would not for the world they saw thee here.
1554		
1555		Romeo.
1556		I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
1557		And, but thou love me, let them find me here.
1558		My life were better ended by their hate
1559		Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
1560		
1561		Juliet.
1562		By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
1563		
1564		Romeo.
1565		By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;
1566		He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
1567		I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1568		As that vast shore wash'd with the furthest sea,
1569		I would adventure for such merchandise.
1570		
1571		Juliet.
1572		Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
1573		Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1574		For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
1575		Fain would I dwell on form,fain, fain deny
1576		What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
1577		Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say Ay;
1578		And I will take thy word: yet, if thou swear'st,
1579		Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries,
1580		They say Jove laughs.  O gentle Romeo,
1581		If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
1582		Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
1583		I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
1584		So thou wilt woo: but else, not for the world.
1585		In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;
1586		And therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour light:
1587		But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1588		Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
1589		I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1590		But that thou overheard'st, ere I was 'ware,
1591		My true-love passion: therefore pardon me;
1592		And not impute this yielding to light love,
1593		Which the dark night hath so discovered.
1594		
1595		Romeo.
1596		Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
1597		That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,--
1598		
1599		Juliet.
1600		O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1601		That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1602		Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
1603		
1604		Romeo.
1605		What shall I swear by?
1606		
1607		Juliet.
1608		Do not swear at all;
1609		Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1610		Which is the god of my idolatry,
1611		And I'll believe thee.
1612		
1613		Romeo.
1614		If my heart's dear love,--
1615		
1616		Juliet.
1617		Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1618		I have no joy of this contract to-night;
1619		It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
1620		Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1621		Ere one can say It lightens.  Sweet, good night!
1622		This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1623		May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1624		Good night, good night!  as sweet repose and rest
1625		Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
1626		
1627		Romeo.
1628		O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1629		
1630		Juliet.
1631		What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
1632		
1633		Romeo.
1634		The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1635		
1636		Juliet.
1637		I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
1638		And yet I would it were to give again.
1639		
1640		Romeo.
1641		Would'st thou withdraw it?  for what purpose, love?
1642		
1643		Juliet.
1644		But to be frank and give it thee again.
1645		And yet I wish but for the thing I have;
1646		My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1647		My love as deep;  the more I give to thee,
1648		The more I have, for both are infinite.
1649		I hear some noise within: dear love, adieu!--
1650		[Nurse calls within.]
1651		Anon, good nurse!--Sweet Montague, be true.
1652		Stay but a little, I will come again.
1653		
1654		[Exit.]
1655		
1656		Romeo.
1657		O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
1658		Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1659		Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
1660		
1661		[Enter Juliet above.]
1662		
1663		Juliet.
1664		Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1665		If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1666		Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1667		By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1668		Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1669		And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1670		And follow thee, my lord, throughout the world.
1671		
1672		Nurse.
1673		[Within.] Madam!
1674		
1675		Juliet.
1676		I come anon.-- But if thou meanest not well,
1677		I do beseech thee,--
1678		
1679		Nurse.
1680		[Within.] Madam!
1681		
1682		Juliet.
1683		By-and-by I come:--
1684		To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief:
1685		To-morrow will I send.
1686		
1687		Romeo.
1688		So thrive my soul,--
1689		
1690		Juliet.
1691		A thousand times good night!
1692		
1693		[Exit.]
1694		
1695		Romeo.
1696		A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!--
1697		Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
1698		But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
1699		
1700		[Retirong slowly.]
1701		
1702		[Re-enter Juliet, above.]
1703		
1704		Juliet.
1705		Hist! Romeo, hist!--O for a falconer's voice
1706		To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1707		Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
1708		Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1709		And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
1710		With repetition of my Romeo's name.
1711		
1712		Romeo.
1713		It is my soul that calls upon my name:
1714		How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1715		Like softest music to attending ears!
1716		
1717		Juliet.
1718		Romeo!
1719		
1720		Romeo.
1721		My dear?
1722		
1723		Juliet.
1724		At what o'clock to-morrow
1725		Shall I send to thee?
1726		
1727		Romeo.
1728		At the hour of nine.
1729		
1730		Juliet.
1731		I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1732		I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1733		
1734		Romeo.
1735		Let me stand here till thou remember it.
1736		
1737		Juliet.
1738		I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1739		Remembering how I love thy company.
1740		
1741		Romeo.
1742		And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1743		Forgetting any other home but this.
1744		
1745		Juliet.
1746		'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
1747		And yet no farther than a wanton's bird;
1748		That lets it hop a little from her hand,
1749		Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1750		And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
1751		So loving-jealous of his liberty.
1752		
1753		Romeo.
1754		I would I were thy bird.
1755		
1756		Juliet.
1757		Sweet, so would I:
1758		Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
1759		Good night, good night!  parting is such sweet sorrow
1760		That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
1761		
1762		[Exit.]
1763		
1764		Romeo.
1765		Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!--
1766		Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
1767		Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
1768		His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
1769

1773		Scene III. Friar Lawrence's Cell.
1774		
1775		[Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.]
1776		
1777		Friar.
1778		The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
1779		Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;
1780		And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
1781		From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
1782		Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1783		The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1784		I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
1785		With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1786		The earth, that's nature's mother, is her tomb;
1787		What is her burying gave, that is her womb:
1788		And from her womb children of divers kind
1789		We sucking on her natural bosom find;
1790		Many for many virtues excellent,
1791		None but for some, and yet all different.
1792		O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1793		In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities:
1794		For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
1795		But to the earth some special good doth give;
1796		Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
1797		Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
1798		Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
1799		And vice sometimes by action dignified.
1800		Within the infant rind of this small flower
1801		Poison hath residence, and medicine power:
1802		For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
1803		Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
1804		Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1805		In man as well as herbs,--grace and rude will;
1806		And where the worser is predominant,
1807		Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
1808		
1809		[Enter Romeo.]
1810		
1811		Romeo.
1812		Good morrow, father!
1813		
1814		Friar.
1815		Benedicite!
1816		What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?--
1817		Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
1818		So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
1819		Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1820		And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
1821		But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
1822		Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
1823		Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1824		Thou art uprous'd with some distemperature;
1825		Or if not so, then here I hit it right,--
1826		Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
1827		
1828		Romeo.
1829		That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
1830		
1831		Friar.
1832		God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
1833		
1834		Romeo.
1835		With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
1836		I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
1837		
1838		Friar.
1839		That's my good son: but where hast thou been then?
1840		
1841		Romeo.
1842		I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
1843		I have been feasting with mine enemy;
1844		Where, on a sudden, one hath wounded me
1845		That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
1846		Within thy help and holy physic lies;
1847		I bear no hatred, blessed man; for, lo,
1848		My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1849		
1850		Friar.
1851		Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
1852		Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
1853		
1854		Romeo.
1855		Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1856		On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
1857		As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
1858		And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
1859		By holy marriage: when, and where, and how
1860		We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
1861		I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
1862		That thou consent to marry us to-day.
1863		
1864		Friar.
1865		Holy Saint Francis! what a change is here!
1866		Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
1867		So soon forsaken? young men's love, then, lies
1868		Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1869		Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1870		Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1871		How much salt water thrown away in waste,
1872		To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1873		The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1874		Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears;
1875		Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1876		Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
1877		If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
1878		Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline;
1879		And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then,--
1880		Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
1881		
1882		Romeo.
1883		Thou chidd'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
1884		
1885		Friar.
1886		For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
1887		
1888		Romeo.
1889		And bad'st me bury love.
1890		
1891		Friar.
1892		Not in a grave
1893		To lay one in, another out to have.
1894		
1895		Romeo.
1896		I pray thee chide not: she whom I love now
1897		Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
1898		The other did not so.
1899		
1900		Friar.
1901		O, she knew well
1902		Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
1903		But come, young waverer, come go with me,
1904		In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
1905		For this alliance may so happy prove,
1906		To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
1907		
1908		Romeo.
1909		O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
1910		
1911		Friar.
1912		Wisely, and slow; they stumble that run fast.
1913		
1914		[Exeunt.]

1917		Scene IV. A Street.
1918		
1919		[Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.]
1920		
1921		Mercutio.
1922		Where the devil should this Romeo be?--
1923		Came he not home to-night?
1924		
1925		Benvolio.
1926		Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
1927		
1928		Mercutio.
1929		Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
1930		Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
1931		
1932		Benvolio.
1933		Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
1934		Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
1935		
1936		Mercutio.
1937		A challenge, on my life.
1938		
1939		Benvolio.
1940		Romeo will answer it.
1941		
1942		Mercutio.
1943		Any man that can write may answer a letter.
1944		
1945		Benvolio.
1946		Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
1947		dares, being dared.
1948		
1949		Mercutio.
1950		Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabbed with a white
1951		wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
1952		very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft:
1953		and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
1954		
1955		Benvolio.
1956		Why, what is Tybalt?
1957		
1958		Mercutio.
1959		More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
1960		courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
1961		prick-song--keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
1962		minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very
1963		butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of
1964		the very first house,--of the first and second cause: ah, the
1965		immortal passado! the punto reverso! the hay.--
1966		
1967		Benvolio.
1968		The what?
1969		
1970		Mercutio.
1971		The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes; these
1972		new tuners of accents!--'By Jesu, a very good blade!--a very tall
1973		man!--a very good whore!'--Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
1974		grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
1975		flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardonnez-moi's, who stand so
1976		much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
1977		bench? O, their bons, their bons!
1978		
1979		Benvolio.
1980		Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!
1981		
1982		Mercutio.
1983		Without his roe, like a dried herring.--O flesh, flesh, how art
1984		thou fishified!--Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed
1985		in: Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench,--marry, she had
1986		a better love to be-rhyme her; Dido, a dowdy; Cleopatra, a gypsy;
1987		Helen and Hero, hildings and harlots; Thisbe, a gray eye or so,
1988		but not to the purpose,--
1989		
1990		[Enter Romeo.]
1991		
1992		Signior Romeo, bon jour!  there's a French salutation to your
1993		French slop.  You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
1994		
1995		Romeo.
1996		Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
1997		
1998		Mercutio.
1999		The slip, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
2000		
2001		Romeo.
2002		Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a
2003		case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
2004		
2005		Mercutio.
2006		That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
2007		man to bow in the hams.
2008		
2009		Romeo.
2010		Meaning, to court'sy.
2011		
2012		Mercutio.
2013		Thou hast most kindly hit it.
2014		
2015		Romeo.
2016		A most courteous exposition.
2017		
2018		Mercutio.
2019		Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
2020		
2021		Romeo.
2022		Pink for flower.
2023		
2024		Mercutio.
2025		Right.
2026		
2027		Romeo.
2028		Why, then is my pump well-flowered.
2029		
2030		Mercutio.
2031		Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
2032		thy pump;that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
2033		remain, after the wearing, sole singular.
2034		
2035		Romeo.
2036		O single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!
2037		
2038		Mercutio.
2039		Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
2040		
2041		Romeo.
2042		Swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
2043		
2044		Mercutio.
2045		Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have done; for
2046		thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than, I am
2047		sure, I have in my whole five: was I with you there for the
2048		goose?
2049		
2050		Romeo.
2051		Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not
2052		there for the goose.
2053		
2054		Mercutio.
2055		I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
2056		
2057		Romeo.
2058		Nay, good goose, bite not.
2059		
2060		Mercutio.
2061		Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp
2062		sauce.
2063		
2064		Romeo.
2065		And is it not, then, well served in to a sweet goose?
2066		
2067		Mercutio.
2068		O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
2069		narrow to an ell broad!
2070		
2071		Romeo.
2072		I stretch it out for that word broad: which added to the
2073		goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
2074		
2075		Mercutio.
2076		Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? now art
2077		thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by
2078		art as well as by nature: for this drivelling love is like a
2079		great natural, that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble
2080		in a hole.
2081		
2082		Benvolio.
2083		Stop there, stop there.
2084		
2085		Mercutio.
2086		Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
2087		
2088		Benvolio.
2089		Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
2090		
2091		Mercutio.
2092		O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short: for I was
2093		come to the whole depth of my tale; and meant indeed to occupy
2094		the argument no longer.
2095		
2096		Romeo.
2097		Here's goodly gear!
2098		
2099		[Enter Nurse and Peter.]
2100		
2101		Mercutio.
2102		A sail, a sail, a sail!
2103		
2104		Benvolio.
2105		Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
2106		
2107		Nurse.
2108		Peter!
2109		
2110		Peter.
2111		Anon.
2112		
2113		Nurse.
2114		My fan, Peter.
2115		
2116		Mercutio.
2117		Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face.
2118		
2119		Nurse.
2120		God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
2121		
2122		Mercutio.
2123		God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
2124		
2125		Nurse.
2126		Is it good-den?
2127		
2128		Mercutio.
2129		'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is
2130		now upon the prick of noon.
2131		
2132		Nurse.
2133		Out upon you! what a man are you!
2134		
2135		Romeo.
2136		One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
2137		
2138		Nurse.
2139		By my troth, it is well said;--for himself to mar, quoth
2140		'a?--Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young
2141		Romeo?
2142		
2143		Romeo.
2144		I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have
2145		found him than he was when you sought him: I am the youngest of
2146		that name, for fault of a worse.
2147		
2148		Nurse.
2149		You say well.
2150		
2151		Mercutio.
2152		Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith; wisely,
2153		wisely.
2154		
2155		Nurse.
2156		If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
2157		
2158		Benvolio.
2159		She will indite him to some supper.
2160		
2161		Mercutio.
2162		A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
2163		
2164		Romeo.
2165		What hast thou found?
2166		
2167		Mercutio.
2168		No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
2169		something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
2170		[Sings.]
2171		    An old hare hoar,
2172		    And an old hare hoar,
2173		  Is very good meat in Lent;
2174		    But a hare that is hoar
2175		    Is too much for a score
2176		  When it hoars ere it be spent.
2177		
2178		Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll to dinner thither.
2179		
2180		Romeo.
2181		I will follow you.
2182		
2183		Mercutio.
2184		Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,--
2185		[singing] lady, lady, lady.
2186		
2187		[Exeunt Mercutio, and Benvolio.]
2188		
2189		Nurse.
2190		Marry, farewell!--I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was
2191		this that was so full of his ropery?
2192		
2193		Romeo.
2194		A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk; and
2195		will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
2196		
2197		Nurse.
2198		An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an'a
2199		were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks; and if I cannot,
2200		I'll find those that shall.  Scurvy knave!  I am none of his
2201		flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates.--And thou must stand
2202		by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
2203		
2204		Peter.  I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon
2205		should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare draw as soon
2206		as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law
2207		on my side.
2208		
2209		Nurse.
2210		Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
2211		quivers. Scurvy knave!--Pray you, sir, a word: and, as I told
2212		you, my young lady bid me enquire you out; what she bade me say I
2213		will keep to myself: but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead
2214		her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
2215		kind of behaviour, as they say: for the gentlewoman is young;
2216		and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were
2217		an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very weak
2218		dealing.
2219		
2220		Romeo.
2221		Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
2222		thee,--
2223		
2224		Nurse.
2225		Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much: Lord,
2226		Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
2227		
2228		Romeo.
2229		What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
2230		
2231		Nurse.
2232		I will tell her, sir,--that you do protest: which, as I
2233		take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
2234		
2235		Romeo.
2236		Bid her devise some means to come to shrift
2237		This afternoon;
2238		And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell
2239		Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.
2240		
2241		Nurse.
2242		No, truly, sir; not a penny.
2243		
2244		Romeo.
2245		Go to; I say you shall.
2246		
2247		Nurse.
2248		This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
2249		
2250		Romeo.
2251		And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey-wall:
2252		Within this hour my man shall be with thee,
2253		And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
2254		Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
2255		Must be my convoy in the secret night.
2256		Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
2257		Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
2258		
2259		Nurse.
2260		Now God in heaven bless thee!--Hark you, sir.
2261		
2262		Romeo.
2263		What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
2264		
2265		Nurse.
2266		Is your man secret?  Did you ne'er hear say,
2267		Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
2268		
2269		Romeo.
2270		I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
2271		
2272		Nurse.
2273		Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady.--Lord, Lord!
2274		when 'twas a little prating thing,--O, there's a nobleman in
2275		town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good
2276		soul, had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him.  I anger
2277		her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man; but
2278		I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout
2279		in the versal world.  Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with
2280		a letter?
2281		
2282		Romeo.
2283		Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
2284		
2285		Nurse.
2286		Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the dog: no; I
2287		know it begins with some other letter:--and she hath the
2288		prettiest sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would
2289		do you good to hear it.
2290		
2291		Romeo.
2292		Commend me to thy lady.
2293		
2294		Nurse.
2295		Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.]--Peter!
2296		
2297		Peter.
2298		Anon?
2299		
2300		Nurse.
2301		Peter, take my fan, and go before.
2302

2306		Scene V. Capulet's Garden.
2307		
2308		[Enter Juliet.]
2309		
2310		Juliet.
2311		The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
2312		In half an hour she promis'd to return.
2313		Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.--
2314		O, she is lame!  love's heralds should be thoughts,
2315		Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
2316		Driving back shadows over lowering hills:
2317		Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
2318		And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
2319		Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
2320		Of this day's journey; and from nine till twelve
2321		Is three long hours,--yet she is not come.
2322		Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
2323		She'd be as swift in motion as a ball;
2324		My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
2325		And his to me:
2326		But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
2327		Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.--
2328		O God, she comes!
2329		[Enter Nurse and Peter].
2330		O honey nurse, what news?
2331		Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
2332		
2333		Nurse.
2334		Peter, stay at the gate.
2335		
2336		[Exit Peter.]
2337		
2338		Juliet.
2339		Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
2340		Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
2341		If good, thou sham'st the music of sweet news
2342		By playing it to me with so sour a face.
2343		
2344		Nurse.
2345		I am aweary, give me leave awhile;--
2346		Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
2347		
2348		Juliet.
2349		I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
2350		Nay, come, I pray thee speak;--good, good nurse, speak.
2351		
2352		Nurse.
2353		Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
2354		Do you not see that I am out of breath?
2355		
2356		Juliet.
2357		How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
2358		To say to me that thou art out of breath?
2359		The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
2360		Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
2361		Is thy news good or bad? answer to that;
2362		Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
2363		Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
2364		
2365		Nurse.
2366		Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
2367		choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; rhough his face be better than
2368		any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a
2369		foot, and a body,--though they be not to be talked on, yet they
2370		are past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,--but I'll
2371		warrant him as gentle as a lamb.--Go thy ways, wench; serve God.-
2372		-What, have you dined at home?
2373		
2374		Juliet.
2375		No, no: but all this did I know before.
2376		What says he of our marriage? what of that?
2377		
2378		Nurse.
2379		Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
2380		It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
2381		My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!--
2382		Beshrew your heart for sending me about
2383		To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
2384		
2385		Juliet.
2386		I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
2387		Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
2388		
2389		Nurse.
2390		Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
2391		And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome;
2392		And, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
2393		
2394		Juliet.
2395		Where is my mother?--why, she is within;
2396		Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
2397		'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,--
2398		'Where is your mother?'
2399		
2400		Nurse.
2401		O God's lady dear!
2402		Are you so hot? marry,come up, I trow;
2403		Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
2404		Henceforward,do your messages yourself.
2405		
2406		Juliet.
2407		Here's such a coil!--come, what says Romeo?
2408		
2409		Nurse.
2410		Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
2411		
2412		Juliet.
2413		I have.
2414		
2415		Nurse.
2416		Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence' cell;
2417		There stays a husband to make you a wife:
2418		Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
2419		They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
2420		Hie you to church; I must another way,
2421		To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
2422		Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
2423		I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
2424		But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
2425		Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
2426		
2427		Juliet.
2428		Hie to high fortune!--honest nurse, farewell.
2429		
2430		[Exeunt.]

2433		Scene VI. Friar Lawrence's Cell.
2434		
2435		[Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.]
2436		
2437		Friar.
2438		So smile the heavens upon this holy act
2439		That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
2440		
2441		Romeo.
2442		Amen, amen!  but come what sorrow can,
2443		It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
2444		That one short minute gives me in her sight:
2445		Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
2446		Then love-devouring death do what he dare,--
2447		It is enough I may but call her mine.
2448		
2449		Friar.
2450		These violent delights have violent ends,
2451		And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,
2452		Which, as they kiss, consume: the sweetest honey
2453		Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
2454		And in the taste confounds the appetite:
2455		Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
2456		Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
2457		Here comes the lady:--O, so light a foot
2458		Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
2459		A lover may bestride the gossamer
2460		That idles in the wanton summer air
2461		And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
2462		
2463		[Enter Juliet.]
2464		
2465		Juliet.
2466		Good-even to my ghostly confessor.
2467		
2468		Friar.
2469		Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
2470		
2471		Juliet.
2472		As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
2473		
2474		Romeo.
2475		Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
2476		Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
2477		To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
2478		This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
2479		Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
2480		Receive in either by this dear encounter.
2481		
2482		Juliet.
2483		Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
2484		Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
2485		They are but beggars that can count their worth;
2486		But my true love is grown to such excess,
2487		I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
2488		
2489		Friar.
2490		Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
2491		For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
2492		Till holy church incorporate two in one.

2497		ACT III.
2498		
2499		Scene I. A public Place.
2500		
2501		[Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page, and Servants.]
2502		
2503		Benvolio.
2504		I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
2505		The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
2506		And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
2507		For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
2508		
2509		Mercutio.
2510		Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the
2511		confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says
2512		'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the second
2513		cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
2514		
2515		Benvolio.
2516		Am I like such a fellow?
2517		
2518		Mercutio.
2519		Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in
2520		Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
2521		moved.
2522		
2523		Benvolio.
2524		And what to?
2525		
2526		Mercutio.
2527		Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for
2528		one would kill the other.  Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a
2529		man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou
2530		hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
2531		other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes;--what eye but such
2532		an eye would spy out such a quarrel?  Thy head is as full of
2533		quarrels as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been
2534		beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling.  Thou hast quarrelled
2535		with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened
2536		thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun.  Didst thou not fall
2537		out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with
2538		another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? and yet thou
2539		wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
2540		
2541		Benvolio.
2542		An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy
2543		the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
2544		
2545		Mercutio.
2546		The fee simple! O simple!
2547		
2548		Benvolio.
2549		By my head, here come the Capulets.
2550		
2551		Mercutio.
2552		By my heel, I care not.
2553		
2554		[Enter Tybalt and others.]
2555		
2556		Tybalt.
2557		Follow me close, for I will speak to them.--Gentlemen, good-den:
2558		a word with one of you.
2559		
2560		Mercutio.
2561		And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make
2562		it a word and a blow.
2563		
2564		Tybalt.
2565		You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give
2566		me occasion.
2567		
2568		Mercutio.
2569		Could you not take some occasion without giving?
2570		
2571		Tybalt.
2572		Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo,--
2573		
2574		Mercutio.
2575		Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels?  An thou make
2576		minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords: here's my
2577		fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
2578		
2579		Benvolio.
2580		We talk here in the public haunt of men:
2581		Either withdraw unto some private place,
2582		And reason coldly of your grievances,
2583		Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
2584		
2585		Mercutio.
2586		Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
2587		I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
2588		
2589		Tybalt.
2590		Well, peace be with you, sir.--Here comes my man.
2591		
2592		[Enter Romeo.]
2593		
2594		Mercutio.
2595		But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
2596		Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
2597		Your worship in that sense may call him man.
2598		
2599		Tybalt.
2600		Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
2601		No better term than this,--Thou art a villain.
2602		
2603		Romeo.
2604		Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2605		Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2606		To such a greeting.  Villain am I none;
2607		Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
2608		
2609		Tybalt.
2610		Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2611		That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
2612		
2613		Romeo.
2614		I do protest I never injur'd thee;
2615		But love thee better than thou canst devise
2616		Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
2617		And so good Capulet,--which name I tender
2618		As dearly as mine own,--be satisfied.
2619		
2620		Mercutio.
2621		O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
2622		Alla stoccata carries it away.  [Draws.]
2623		Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
2624		
2625		Tybalt.
2626		What wouldst thou have with me?
2627		
2628		Mercutio.
2629		Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I
2630		mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,
2631		dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of
2632		his pitcher by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your ears
2633		ere it be out.
2634		
2635		Tybalt.
2636		I am for you.  [Drawing.]
2637		
2638		Romeo.
2639		Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2640		
2641		Mercutio.
2642		Come, sir, your passado.
2643		
2644		[They fight.]
2645		
2646		Romeo.
2647		Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.--
2648		Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!--
2649		Tybalt,--Mercutio,--the prince expressly hath
2650		Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.--
2651		Hold, Tybalt!--good Mercutio!--
2652		[Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans.]
2653		
2654		Mercutio.
2655		I am hurt;--
2656		A plague o' both your houses!--I am sped.--
2657		Is he gone, and hath nothing?
2658		
2659		Benvolio.
2660		What, art thou hurt?
2661		
2662		Mercutio.
2663		Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.--
2664		Where is my page?--go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2665		
2666		[Exit Page.]
2667		
2668		Romeo.
2669		Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
2670		
2671		Mercutio.
2672		No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
2673		but 'tis enough, 'twill serve: ask for me to-morrow, and you
2674		shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this
2675		world.--A plague o' both your houses!--Zounds, a dog, a rat, a
2676		mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue, a
2677		villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic!--Why the devil
2678		came you between us?  I was hurt under your arm.
2679		
2680		Romeo.
2681		I thought all for the best.
2682		
2683		Mercutio.
2684		Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2685		Or I shall faint.--A plague o' both your houses!
2686		They have made worms' meat of me:
2687		I have it, and soundly too.--Your houses!
2688		
2689		[Exit Mercutio and Benvolio.]
2690		
2691		Romeo.
2692		This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
2693		My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
2694		In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
2695		With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
2696		Hath been my kinsman.--O sweet Juliet,
2697		Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2698		And in my temper soften'd valour's steel.
2699		
2700		[Re-enter Benvolio.]
2701		
2702		Benvolio.
2703		O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
2704		That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
2705		Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2706		
2707		Romeo.
2708		This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
2709		This but begins the woe others must end.
2710		
2711		Benvolio.
2712		Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2713		
2714		Romeo.
2715		Alive in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
2716		Away to heaven respective lenity,
2717		And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!--
2718		
2719		[Re-enter Tybalt.]
2720		
2721		Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
2722		That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
2723		Is but a little way above our heads,
2724		Staying for thine to keep him company.
2725		Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
2726		
2727		Tybalt.
2728		Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
2729		Shalt with him hence.
2730		
2731		Romeo.
2732		This shall determine that.
2733		
2734		[They fight; Tybalt falls.]
2735		
2736		Benvolio.
2737		Romeo, away, be gone!
2738		The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.--
2739		Stand not amaz'd.  The prince will doom thee death
2740		If thou art taken.  Hence, be gone, away!
2741		
2742		Romeo.
2743		O, I am fortune's fool!
2744		
2745		Benvolio.
2746		Why dost thou stay?
2747		
2748		[Exit Romeo.]
2749		
2750		[Enter Citizens, &c.]
2751		
2752		1 Citizen.
2753		Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
2754		Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
2755		
2756		Benvolio.
2757		There lies that Tybalt.
2758		
2759		1 Citizen.
2760		Up, sir, go with me;
2761		I charge thee in the prince's name obey.
2762		
2763		[Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives,
2764		and others.]
2765		
2766		Prince.
2767		Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2768		
2769		Benvolio.
2770		O noble prince. I can discover all
2771		The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
2772		There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2773		That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2774		
2775		Lady Capulet.
2776		Tybalt, my cousin!  O my brother's child!--
2777		O prince!--O husband!--O, the blood is spill'd
2778		Of my dear kinsman!--Prince, as thou art true,
2779		For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.--
2780		O cousin, cousin!
2781		
2782		Prince.
2783		Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2784		
2785		Benvolio.
2786		Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
2787		Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
2788		How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
2789		Your high displeasure.--All this,--uttered
2790		With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,--
2791		Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2792		Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2793		With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
2794		Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
2795		And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2796		Cold death aside, and with the other sends
2797		It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
2798		Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
2799		'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
2800		His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2801		And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2802		An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2803		Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled:
2804		But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
2805		Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
2806		And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
2807		Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;
2808		And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.
2809		This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2810		
2811		Lady Capulet.
2812		He is a kinsman to the Montague,
2813		Affection makes him false, he speaks not true:
2814		Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2815		And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2816		I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
2817		Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
2818		
2819		Prince.
2820		Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio:
2821		Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2822		
2823		Montague.
2824		Not Romeo, prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
2825		His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2826		The life of Tybalt.
2827		
2828		Prince.
2829		And for that offence
2830		Immediately we do exile him hence:
2831		I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
2832		My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
2833		But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2834		That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
2835		I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
2836		Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses,
2837		Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
2838		Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
2839		Bear hence this body, and attend our will:
2840		Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
2841		
2842		[Exeunt.]
2843		
2844		
2845		Scene II. A Room in Capulet's House.
2846		
2847		[Enter Juliet.]
2848		
2849		Juliet.
2850		Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2851		Towards Phoebus' lodging; such a waggoner
2852		As Phaeton would whip you to the west
2853		And bring in cloudy night immediately.--
2854		Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night!
2855		That rude eyes may wink, and Romeo
2856		Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.--
2857		Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2858		By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,
2859		It best agrees with night.--Come, civil night,
2860		Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
2861		And learn me how to lose a winning match,
2862		Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
2863		Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
2864		With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
2865		Think true love acted simple modesty.
2866		Come, night;--come, Romeo;--come, thou day in night;
2867		For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2868		Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.--
2869		Come, gentle night;--come, loving, black-brow'd night,
2870		Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
2871		Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2872		And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2873		That all the world will be in love with night,
2874		And pay no worship to the garish sun.--
2875		O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
2876		But not possess'd it; and, though I am sold,
2877		Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
2878		As is the night before some festival
2879		To an impatient child that hath new robes,
2880		And may not wear them.  O, here comes my nurse,
2881		And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
2882		But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.--
2883		
2884		[Enter Nurse, with cords.]
2885		
2886		Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
2887		That Romeo bid thee fetch?
2888		
2889		Nurse.
2890		Ay, ay, the cords.
2891		
2892		[Throws them down.]
2893		
2894		Juliet.
2895		Ah me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
2896		
2897		Nurse.
2898		Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
2899		We are undone, lady, we are undone!--
2900		Alack the day!--he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
2901		
2902		Juliet.
2903		Can heaven be so envious?
2904		
2905		Nurse.
2906		Romeo can,
2907		Though heaven cannot.--O Romeo, Romeo!--
2908		Who ever would have thought it?--Romeo!
2909		
2910		Juliet.
2911		What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
2912		This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
2913		Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but I,
2914		And that bare vowel I shall poison more
2915		Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
2916		I am not I if there be such an I;
2917		Or those eyes shut that make thee answer I.
2918		If he be slain, say I; or if not, no:
2919		Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
2920		
2921		Nurse.
2922		I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
2923		God save the mark!--here on his manly breast.
2924		A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
2925		Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
2926		All in gore-blood;--I swounded at the sight.
2927		
2928		Juliet.
2929		O, break, my heart!--poor bankrout, break at once!
2930		To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
2931		Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
2932		And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
2933		
2934		Nurse.
2935		O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2936		O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
2937		That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2938		
2939		Juliet.
2940		What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2941		Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
2942		My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?--
2943		Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
2944		For who is living, if those two are gone?
2945		
2946		Nurse.
2947		Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
2948		Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
2949		
2950		Juliet.
2951		O God!--did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2952		
2953		Nurse.
2954		It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
2955		
2956		Juliet.
2957		O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
2958		Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2959		Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
2960		Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
2961		Despised substance of divinest show!
2962		Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
2963		A damned saint, an honourable villain!--
2964		O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
2965		When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2966		In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?--
2967		Was ever book containing such vile matter
2968		So fairly bound?  O, that deceit should dwell
2969		In such a gorgeous palace!
2970		
2971		Nurse.
2972		There's no trust,
2973		No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
2974		All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.--
2975		Ah, where's my man?  Give me some aqua vitae.--
2976		These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
2977		Shame come to Romeo!
2978		
2979		Juliet.
2980		Blister'd be thy tongue
2981		For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
2982		Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
2983		For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
2984		Sole monarch of the universal earth.
2985		O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2986		
2987		Nurse.
2988		Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
2989		
2990		Juliet.
2991		Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2992		Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
2993		When I, thy three-hours' wife, have mangled it?--
2994		But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2995		That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
2996		Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
2997		Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2998		Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2999		My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
3000		And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
3001		All this is comfort; wherefore weep I, then?
3002		Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
3003		That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
3004		But O, it presses to my memory
3005		Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
3006		'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.'
3007		That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
3008		Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts.  Tybalt's death
3009		Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
3010		Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship,
3011		And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,--
3012		Why follow'd not, when she said Tybalt's dead,
3013		Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
3014		Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
3015		But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
3016		'Romeo is banished'--to speak that word
3017		Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
3018		All slain, all dead: 'Romeo is banished,'--
3019		There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
3020		In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.--
3021		Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
3022		
3023		Nurse.
3024		Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
3025		Will you go to them?  I will bring you thither.
3026		
3027		Juliet.
3028		Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
3029		When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
3030		Take up those cords.  Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
3031		Both you and I; for Romeo is exil'd:
3032		He made you for a highway to my bed;
3033		But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
3034		Come, cords; come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
3035		And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
3036		
3037		Nurse.
3038		Hie to your chamber.  I'll find Romeo
3039		To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
3040		Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
3041		I'll to him; he is hid at Lawrence' cell.
3042		
3043		Juliet.
3044		O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
3045		And bid him come to take his last farewell.
3046		
3047		[Exeunt.]
3048		
3049		
3050		Scene III. Friar Lawrence's cell.
3051		
3052		[Enter Friar Lawrence.]
3053		
3054		Friar.
3055		Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
3056		Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
3057		And thou art wedded to calamity.
3058		
3059		[Enter Romeo.]
3060		
3061		Romeo.
3062		Father, what news?  what is the prince's doom
3063		What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
3064		That I yet know not?
3065		
3066		Friar.
3067		Too familiar
3068		Is my dear son with such sour company:
3069		I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
3070		
3071		Romeo.
3072		What less than doomsday is the prince's doom?
3073		
3074		Friar.
3075		A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,--
3076		Not body's death, but body's banishment.
3077		
3078		Romeo.
3079		Ha, banishment? be merciful, say death;
3080		For exile hath more terror in his look,
3081		Much more than death; do not say banishment.
3082		
3083		Friar.
3084		Hence from Verona art thou banished:
3085		Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
3086		
3087		Romeo.
3088		There is no world without Verona walls,
3089		But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
3090		Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
3091		And world's exile is death,--then banished
3092		Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
3093		Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
3094		And smil'st upon the stroke that murders me.
3095		
3096		Friar.
3097		O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
3098		Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
3099		Taking thy part, hath brush'd aside the law,
3100		And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
3101		This is dear mercy, and thou see'st it not.
3102		
3103		Romeo.
3104		'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
3105		Where Juliet lives; and every cat, and dog,
3106		And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
3107		Live here in heaven, and may look on her;
3108		But Romeo may not.--More validity,
3109		More honourable state, more courtship lives
3110		In carrion flies than Romeo: they may seize
3111		On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand,
3112		And steal immortal blessing from her lips;
3113		Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
3114		Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
3115		But Romeo may not; he is banished,--
3116		This may flies do, when I from this must fly.
3117		And sayest thou yet that exile is not death!
3118		Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
3119		No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
3120		But banished to kill me; banished?
3121		O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
3122		Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
3123		Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
3124		A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
3125		To mangle me with that word banishment?
3126		
3127		Friar.
3128		Thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,--
3129		
3130		Romeo.
3131		O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
3132		
3133		Friar.
3134		I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
3135		Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
3136		To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
3137		
3138		Romeo.
3139		Yet banished? Hang up philosophy!
3140		Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
3141		Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
3142		It helps not, it prevails not,--talk no more.
3143		
3144		Friar.
3145		O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
3146		
3147		Romeo.
3148		How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
3149		
3150		Friar.
3151		Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
3152		
3153		Romeo.
3154		Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
3155		Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
3156		An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
3157		Doting like me, and like me banished,
3158		Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
3159		And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
3160		Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
3161		
3162		[Knocking within.]
3163		
3164		Friar.
3165		Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
3166		
3167		Romeo.
3168		Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
3169		Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.
3170		
3171		[Knocking.]
3172		
3173		Friar.
3174		Hark, how they knock!--Who's there?--Romeo, arise;
3175		Thou wilt be taken.--Stay awhile;--Stand up;
3176		
3177		[Knocking.]
3178		
3179		Run to my study.--By-and-by!--God's will!
3180		What simpleness is this.--I come, I come!
3181		
3182		[Knocking.]
3183		
3184		Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
3185		
3186		Nurse.
3187		[Within.] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand;
3188		I come from Lady Juliet.
3189		
3190		Friar.
3191		Welcome then.
3192		
3193		[Enter Nurse.]
3194		
3195		Nurse.
3196		O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
3197		Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
3198		
3199		Friar.
3200		There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
3201		
3202		Nurse.
3203		O, he is even in my mistress' case,--
3204		Just in her case!
3205		
3206		Friar.
3207		O woeful sympathy!
3208		Piteous predicament!
3209		
3210		Nurse.
3211		Even so lies she,
3212		Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.--
3213		Stand up, stand up; stand, an you be a man:
3214		For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
3215		Why should you fall into so deep an O?
3216		
3217		Romeo.
3218		Nurse!
3219		
3220		Nurse.
3221		Ah sir! ah sir!--Well, death's the end of all.
3222		
3223		Romeo.
3224		Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
3225		Doth not she think me an old murderer,
3226		Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
3227		With blood remov'd but little from her own?
3228		Where is she? and how doth she/ and what says
3229		My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
3230		
3231		Nurse.
3232		O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
3233		And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
3234		And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
3235		And then down falls again.
3236		
3237		Romeo.
3238		As if that name,
3239		Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
3240		Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
3241		Murder'd her kinsman.--O, tell me, friar, tell me,
3242		In what vile part of this anatomy
3243		Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
3244		The hateful mansion.
3245		
3246		[Drawing his sword.]
3247		
3248		Friar.
3249		Hold thy desperate hand:
3250		Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art;
3251		Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
3252		The unreasonable fury of a beast;
3253		Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
3254		Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
3255		Thou hast amaz'd me: by my holy order,
3256		I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
3257		Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
3258		And slay thy lady, too, that lives in thee,
3259		By doing damned hate upon thyself?
3260		Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
3261		Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
3262		In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
3263		Fie, fie, thou sham'st thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
3264		Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
3265		And usest none in that true use indeed
3266		Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
3267		Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
3268		Digressing from the valour of a man;
3269		Thy dear love sworn, but hollow perjury,
3270		Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
3271		Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
3272		Mis-shapen in the conduct of them both,
3273		Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
3274		Is set a-fire by thine own ignorance,
3275		And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
3276		What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
3277		For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
3278		There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
3279		But thou slewest Tybalt; there art thou happy too:
3280		The law, that threaten'd death, becomes thy friend,
3281		And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
3282		A pack of blessings lights upon thy back;
3283		Happiness courts thee in her best array;
3284		But, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench,
3285		Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:--
3286		Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
3287		Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
3288		Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
3289		But, look, thou stay not till the watch be set,
3290		For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
3291		Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
3292		To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
3293		Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
3294		With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
3295		Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.--
3296		Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
3297		And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
3298		Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
3299		Romeo is coming.
3300		
3301		Nurse.
3302		O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
3303		To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!--
3304		My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
3305		
3306		Romeo.
3307		Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
3308		
3309		Nurse.
3310		Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
3311		Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
3312		
3313		[Exit.]
3314		
3315		Romeo.
3316		How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
3317		
3318		Friar.
3319		Go hence; good night! and here stands all your state:
3320		Either be gone before the watch be set,
3321		Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
3322		Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
3323		And he shall signify from time to time
3324		Every good hap to you that chances here:
3325		Give me thy hand; 'tis late; farewell; good night.
3326		
3327		Romeo.
3328		But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
3329		It were a grief so brief to part with thee:
3330		Farewell.
3331

3335		Scene IV. A Room in Capulet's House.
3336		
3337		[Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, and Paris.]
3338		
3339		Capulet.
3340		Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily
3341		That we have had no time to move our daughter:
3342		Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
3343		And so did I; well, we were born to die.
3344		'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night:
3345		I promise you, but for your company,
3346		I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
3347		
3348		Paris.
3349		These times of woe afford no tune to woo.--
3350		Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
3351		
3352		Lady Capulet.
3353		I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
3354		To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
3355		
3356		Capulet.
3357		Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
3358		Of my child's love: I think she will be rul'd
3359		In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.--
3360		Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
3361		Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
3362		And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,--
3363		But, soft! what day is this?
3364		
3365		Paris.
3366		Monday, my lord.
3367		
3368		Capulet.
3369		Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
3370		Thursday let it be;--a Thursday, tell her,
3371		She shall be married to this noble earl.--
3372		Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
3373		We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
3374		For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
3375		It may be thought we held him carelessly,
3376		Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
3377		Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
3378		And there an end.  But what say you to Thursday?
3379		
3380		Paris.
3381		My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
3382		
3383		Capulet.
3384		Well, get you gone: o' Thursday be it then.--
3385		Go you to Juliet, ere you go to bed,
3386		Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.--
3387		Farewell, my lord.--Light to my chamber, ho!--
3388		Afore me, it is so very very late
3389		That we may call it early by and by.--
3390		Good night.

3395		Scene V. An open Gallery to Juliet's Chamber, overlooking the
3396		Garden.
3397		
3398		[Enter Romeo and Juliet.]
3399		
3400		Juliet.
3401		Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
3402		It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
3403		That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear;
3404		Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree:
3405		Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
3406		
3407		Romeo.
3408		It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
3409		No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
3410		Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
3411		Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
3412		Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
3413		I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
3414		
3415		Juliet.
3416		Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I:
3417		It is some meteor that the sun exhales
3418		To be to thee this night a torch-bearer
3419		And light thee on the way to Mantua:
3420		Therefore stay yet, thou need'st not to be gone.
3421		
3422		Romeo.
3423		Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
3424		I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
3425		I'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye,
3426		'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
3427		Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
3428		The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
3429		I have more care to stay than will to go.--
3430		Come, death, and welcome!  Juliet wills it so.--
3431		How is't, my soul? let's talk,--it is not day.
3432		
3433		Juliet.
3434		It is, it is!--hie hence, be gone, away!
3435		It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
3436		Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
3437		Some say the lark makes sweet division;
3438		This doth not so, for she divideth us:
3439		Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes;
3440		O, now I would they had chang'd voices too!
3441		Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
3442		Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day.
3443		O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
3444		
3445		Romeo.
3446		More light and light,--more dark and dark our woes!
3447		
3448		[Enter Nurse.]
3449		
3450		Nurse.
3451		Madam!
3452		
3453		Juliet.
3454		Nurse?
3455		
3456		Nurse.
3457		Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
3458		The day is broke; be wary, look about.
3459		
3460		[Exit.]
3461		
3462		Juliet.
3463		Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
3464		
3465		Romeo.
3466		Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
3467		
3468		[Descends.]
3469		
3470		Juliet.
3471		Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend!
3472		I must hear from thee every day i' the hour,
3473		For in a minute there are many days:
3474		O, by this count I shall be much in years
3475		Ere I again behold my Romeo!
3476		
3477		Romeo.
3478		Farewell!
3479		I will omit no opportunity
3480		That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
3481		
3482		Juliet.
3483		O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
3484		
3485		Romeo.
3486		I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
3487		For sweet discourses in our time to come.
3488		
3489		Juliet.
3490		O God! I have an ill-divining soul!
3491		Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
3492		As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
3493		Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
3494		
3495		Romeo.
3496		And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
3497		Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
3498		
3499		[Exit below.]
3500		
3501		Juliet.
3502		O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
3503		If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
3504		That is renown'd for faith?  Be fickle, fortune;
3505		For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long
3506		But send him back.
3507		
3508		Lady Capulet.
3509		[Within.] Ho, daughter! are you up?
3510		
3511		Juliet.
3512		Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
3513		Is she not down so late, or up so early?
3514		What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
3515		
3516		[Enter Lady Capulet.]
3517		
3518		Lady Capulet.
3519		Why, how now, Juliet?
3520		
3521		Juliet.
3522		Madam, I am not well.
3523		
3524		Lady Capulet.
3525		Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
3526		What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
3527		An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
3528		Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love;
3529		But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
3530		
3531		Juliet.
3532		Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
3533		
3534		Lady Capulet.
3535		So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
3536		Which you weep for.
3537		
3538		Juliet.
3539		Feeling so the loss,
3540		I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
3541		
3542		Lady Capulet.
3543		Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
3544		As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
3545		
3546		Juliet.
3547		What villain, madam?
3548		
3549		Lady Capulet.
3550		That same villain Romeo.
3551		
3552		Juliet.
3553		Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
3554		God pardon him!  I do, with all my heart;
3555		And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
3556		
3557		Lady Capulet.
3558		That is because the traitor murderer lives.
3559		
3560		Juliet.
3561		Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
3562		Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
3563		
3564		Lady Capulet.
3565		We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
3566		Then weep no more.  I'll send to one in Mantua,--
3567		Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,--
3568		Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
3569		That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
3570		And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
3571		
3572		Juliet.
3573		Indeed I never shall be satisfied
3574		With Romeo till I behold him--dead--
3575		Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd:
3576		Madam, if you could find out but a man
3577		To bear a poison, I would temper it,
3578		That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
3579		Soon sleep in quiet.  O, how my heart abhors
3580		To hear him nam'd,--and cannot come to him,--
3581		To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
3582		Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
3583		
3584		Lady Capulet.
3585		Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
3586		But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
3587		
3588		Juliet.
3589		And joy comes well in such a needy time:
3590		What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
3591		
3592		Lady Capulet.
3593		Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
3594		One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
3595		Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
3596		That thou expect'st not, nor I look'd not for.
3597		
3598		Juliet.
3599		Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
3600		
3601		Lady Capulet.
3602		Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
3603		The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
3604		The County Paris, at St. Peter's Church,
3605		Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
3606		
3607		Juliet.
3608		Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
3609		He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
3610		I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
3611		Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
3612		I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
3613		I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
3614		It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
3615		Rather than Paris:--these are news indeed!
3616		
3617		Lady Capulet.
3618		Here comes your father: tell him so yourself,
3619		And see how he will take it at your hands.
3620		
3621		[Enter Capulet and Nurse.]
3622		
3623		Capulet.
3624		When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
3625		But for the sunset of my brother's son
3626		It rains downright.--
3627		How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
3628		Evermore showering? In one little body
3629		Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
3630		For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
3631		Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
3632		Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
3633		Who,--raging with thy tears and they with them,--
3634		Without a sudden calm, will overset
3635		Thy tempest-tossed body.--How now, wife!
3636		Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
3637		
3638		Lady Capulet.
3639		Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
3640		I would the fool were married to her grave!
3641		
3642		Capulet.
3643		Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
3644		How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
3645		Is she not proud? doth she not count her bles'd,
3646		Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
3647		So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
3648		
3649		Juliet.
3650		Not proud you have; but thankful that you have:
3651		Proud can I never be of what I hate;
3652		But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
3653		
3654		Capulet.
3655		How now, how now, chop-logic!  What is this?
3656		Proud,--and, I thank you,--and I thank you not;--
3657		And yet not proud:--mistress minion, you,
3658		Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
3659		But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
3660		To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
3661		Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
3662		Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
3663		You tallow-face!
3664		
3665		Lady Capulet.
3666		Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
3667		
3668		Juliet.
3669		Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
3670		Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
3671		
3672		Capulet.
3673		Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
3674		I tell thee what,--get thee to church o' Thursday,
3675		Or never after look me in the face:
3676		Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
3677		My fingers itch.--Wife, we scarce thought us bles'd
3678		That God had lent us but this only child;
3679		But now I see this one is one too much,
3680		And that we have a curse in having her:
3681		Out on her, hilding!
3682		
3683		Nurse.
3684		God in heaven bless her!--
3685		You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
3686		
3687		Capulet.
3688		And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
3689		Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
3690		
3691		Nurse.
3692		I speak no treason.
3693		
3694		Capulet.
3695		O, God ye good-en!
3696		
3697		Nurse.
3698		May not one speak?
3699		
3700		Capulet.
3701		Peace, you mumbling fool!
3702		Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
3703		For here we need it not.
3704		
3705		Lady Capulet.
3706		You are too hot.
3707		
3708		Capulet.
3709		God's bread! it makes me mad:
3710		Day, night, hour, time, tide, work, play,
3711		Alone, in company, still my care hath been
3712		To have her match'd, and having now provided
3713		A gentleman of noble parentage,
3714		Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
3715		Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
3716		Proportion'd as one's heart would wish a man,--
3717		And then to have a wretched puling fool,
3718		A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
3719		To answer, 'I'll not wed,--I cannot love,
3720		I am too young,--I pray you pardon me:'--
3721		But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
3722		Graze where you will, you shall not house with me:
3723		Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
3724		Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
3725		An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
3726		An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die i' the streets,
3727		For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
3728		Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
3729		Trust to't, bethink you, I'll not be forsworn.
3730		
3731		[Exit.]
3732		
3733		Juliet.
3734		Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
3735		That sees into the bottom of my grief?
3736		O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
3737		Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
3738		Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
3739		In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
3740		
3741		Lady Capulet.
3742		Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word;
3743		Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
3744		
3745		[Exit.]
3746		
3747		Juliet.
3748		O God!--O nurse! how shall this be prevented?
3749		My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
3750		How shall that faith return again to earth,
3751		Unless that husband send it me from heaven
3752		By leaving earth?--comfort me, counsel me.--
3753		Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
3754		Upon so soft a subject as myself!--
3755		What say'st thou?  hast thou not a word of joy?
3756		Some comfort, nurse.
3757		
3758		Nurse.
3759		Faith, here 'tis; Romeo
3760		Is banished; and all the world to nothing
3761		That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
3762		Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
3763		Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
3764		I think it best you married with the county.
3765		O, he's a lovely gentleman!
3766		Romeo's a dishclout to him; an eagle, madam,
3767		Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
3768		As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
3769		I think you are happy in this second match,
3770		For it excels your first: or if it did not,
3771		Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
3772		As living here, and you no use of him.
3773		
3774		Juliet.
3775		Speakest thou this from thy heart?
3776		
3777		Nurse.
3778		And from my soul too;
3779		Or else beshrew them both.
3780		
3781		Juliet.
3782		Amen!
3783		
3784		Nurse.
3785		What?
3786		
3787		Juliet.
3788		Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
3789		Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
3790		Having displeas'd my father, to Lawrence' cell,
3791		To make confession and to be absolv'd.
3792		
3793		Nurse.
3794		Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
3795		
3796		[Exit.]
3797		
3798		Juliet.
3799		Ancient damnation!  O most wicked fiend!
3800		Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
3801		Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
3802		Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
3803		So many thousand times?--Go, counsellor;
3804		Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.--
3805		I'll to the friar to know his remedy;
3806		If all else fail, myself have power to die.

3811		ACT IV.
3812		
3813		Scene I. Friar Lawrence's Cell.
3814		
3815		[Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.]
3816		
3817		Friar.
3818		On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
3819		
3820		Paris.
3821		My father Capulet will have it so;
3822		And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
3823		
3824		Friar.
3825		You say you do not know the lady's mind:
3826		Uneven is the course; I like it not.
3827		
3828		Paris.
3829		Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
3830		And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
3831		For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
3832		Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
3833		That she do give her sorrow so much sway;
3834		And, in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,
3835		To stop the inundation of her tears;
3836		Which, too much minded by herself alone,
3837		May be put from her by society:
3838		Now do you know the reason of this haste.
3839		
3840		Friar.
3841		[Aside.] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.--
3842		Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
3843		
3844		[Enter Juliet.]
3845		
3846		Paris.
3847		Happily met, my lady and my wife!
3848		
3849		Juliet.
3850		That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
3851		
3852		Paris.
3853		That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
3854		
3855		Juliet.
3856		What must be shall be.
3857		
3858		Friar.
3859		That's a certain text.
3860		
3861		Paris.
3862		Come you to make confession to this father?
3863		
3864		Juliet.
3865		To answer that, I should confess to you.
3866		
3867		Paris.
3868		Do not deny to him that you love me.
3869		
3870		Juliet.
3871		I will confess to you that I love him.
3872		
3873		Paris.
3874		So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
3875		
3876		Juliet.
3877		If I do so, it will be of more price,
3878		Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
3879		
3880		Paris.
3881		Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
3882		
3883		Juliet.
3884		The tears have got small victory by that;
3885		For it was bad enough before their spite.
3886		
3887		Paris.
3888		Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
3889		
3890		Juliet.
3891		That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
3892		And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
3893		
3894		Paris.
3895		Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
3896		
3897		Juliet.
3898		It may be so, for it is not mine own.--
3899		Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
3900		Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
3901		
3902		Friar.
3903		My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.--
3904		My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
3905		
3906		Paris.
3907		God shield I should disturb devotion!--
3908		Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you:
3909		Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
3910		
3911		[Exit.]
3912		
3913		Juliet.
3914		O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
3915		Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
3916		
3917		Friar.
3918		Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
3919		It strains me past the compass of my wits:
3920		I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
3921		On Thursday next be married to this county.
3922		
3923		Juliet.
3924		Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
3925		Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
3926		If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
3927		Do thou but call my resolution wise,
3928		And with this knife I'll help it presently.
3929		God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
3930		And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
3931		Shall be the label to another deed,
3932		Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
3933		Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
3934		Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
3935		Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
3936		'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
3937		Shall play the empire; arbitrating that
3938		Which the commission of thy years and art
3939		Could to no issue of true honour bring.
3940		Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
3941		If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
3942		
3943		Friar.
3944		Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
3945		Which craves as desperate an execution
3946		As that is desperate which we would prevent.
3947		If, rather than to marry County Paris
3948		Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
3949		Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
3950		A thing like death to chide away this shame,
3951		That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
3952		And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
3953		
3954		Juliet.
3955		O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
3956		From off the battlements of yonder tower;
3957		Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
3958		Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
3959		Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
3960		O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
3961		With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
3962		Or bid me go into a new-made grave,
3963		And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
3964		Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
3965		And I will do it without fear or doubt,
3966		To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
3967		
3968		Friar.
3969		Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
3970		To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow;
3971		To-morrow night look that thou lie alone,
3972		Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
3973		Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
3974		And this distilled liquor drink thou off:
3975		When, presently, through all thy veins shall run
3976		A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
3977		Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
3978		No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
3979		The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
3980		To paly ashes; thy eyes' windows fall,
3981		Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
3982		Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
3983		Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
3984		And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
3985		Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
3986		And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
3987		Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
3988		To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
3989		Then,--as the manner of our country is,--
3990		In thy best robes, uncover'd, on the bier,
3991		Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
3992		Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
3993		In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
3994		Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
3995		And hither shall he come: and he and I
3996		Will watch thy waking, and that very night
3997		Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
3998		And this shall free thee from this present shame,
3999		If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
4000		Abate thy valour in the acting it.
4001		
4002		Juliet.
4003		Give me, give me!  O, tell not me of fear!
4004		
4005		Friar.
4006		Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
4007		In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
4008		To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
4009		
4010		Juliet.
4011		Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
4012		Farewell, dear father.
4013

4018		
4019		[Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, Nurse, and Servants.]
4020		
4021		Capulet.
4022		So many guests invite as here are writ.--
4023		
4024		[Exit first Servant.]
4025		
4026		Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
4027		
4028		2 Servant.
4029		You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can
4030		lick their fingers.
4031		
4032		Capulet.
4033		How canst thou try them so?
4034		
4035		2 Servant.
4036		Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers:
4037		therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.
4038		
4039		Capulet.
4040		Go, begone.--
4041		
4042		[Exit second Servant.]
4043		
4044		We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.--
4045		What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?
4046		
4047		Nurse.
4048		Ay, forsooth.
4049		
4050		Capulet.
4051		Well, be may chance to do some good on her:
4052		A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
4053		
4054		Nurse.
4055		See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
4056		
4057		[Enter Juliet.]
4058		
4059		Capulet.
4060		How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
4061		
4062		Juliet.
4063		Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
4064		Of disobedient opposition
4065		To you and your behests; and am enjoin'd
4066		By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,
4067		To beg your pardon:--pardon, I beseech you!
4068		Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
4069		
4070		Capulet.
4071		Send for the county; go tell him of this:
4072		I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
4073		
4074		Juliet.
4075		I met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell;
4076		And gave him what becomed love I might,
4077		Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
4078		
4079		Capulet.
4080		Why, I am glad on't; this is well,--stand up,--
4081		This is as't should be.--Let me see the county;
4082		Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.--
4083		Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
4084		All our whole city is much bound to him.
4085		
4086		Juliet.
4087		Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
4088		To help me sort such needful ornaments
4089		As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
4090		
4091		Lady Capulet.
4092		No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
4093		
4094		Capulet.
4095		Go, nurse, go with her.--We'll to church to-morrow.
4096		
4097		[Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.]
4098		
4099		Lady Capulet.
4100		We shall be short in our provision:
4101		'Tis now near night.
4102		
4103		Capulet.
4104		Tush, I will stir about,
4105		And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
4106		Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
4107		I'll not to bed to-night;--let me alone;
4108		I'll play the housewife for this once.--What, ho!--
4109		They are all forth: well, I will walk myself
4110		To County Paris, to prepare him up
4111		Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light
4112		Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

4118		
4119		[Enter Juliet and Nurse.]
4120		
4121		Juliet.
4122		Ay, those attires are best:--but, gentle nurse,
4123		I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night;
4124		For I have need of many orisons
4125		To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
4126		Which, well thou know'st, is cross and full of sin.
4127		
4128		[Enter Lady Capulet.]
4129		
4130		Lady Capulet.
4131		What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
4132		
4133		Juliet.
4134		No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
4135		As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
4136		So please you, let me now be left alone,
4137		And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
4138		For I am sure you have your hands full all
4139		In this so sudden business.
4140		
4141		Lady Capulet.
4142		Good night:
4143		Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
4144		
4145		[Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.]
4146		
4147		Juliet.
4148		Farewell!--God knows when we shall meet again.
4149		I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
4150		That almost freezes up the heat of life:
4151		I'll call them back again to comfort me;--
4152		Nurse!--What should she do here?
4153		My dismal scene I needs must act alone.--
4154		Come, vial.--
4155		What if this mixture do not work at all?
4156		Shall I be married, then, to-morrow morning?--
4157		No, No!--this shall forbid it:--lie thou there.--
4158		
4159		[Laying down her dagger.]
4160		
4161		What if it be a poison, which the friar
4162		Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
4163		Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
4164		Because he married me before to Romeo?
4165		I fear it is: and yet methinks it should not,
4166		For he hath still been tried a holy man:--
4167		I will not entertain so bad a thought.--
4168		How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
4169		I wake before the time that Romeo
4170		Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
4171		Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
4172		To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
4173		And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
4174		Or, if I live, is it not very like
4175		The horrible conceit of death and night,
4176		Together with the terror of the place,--
4177		As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
4178		Where, for this many hundred years, the bones
4179		Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
4180		Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
4181		Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
4182		At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
4183		Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
4184		So early waking,--what with loathsome smells,
4185		And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
4186		That living mortals, hearing them, run mad;--
4187		O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
4188		Environed with all these hideous fears?
4189		And madly play with my forefathers' joints?
4190		And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
4191		And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
4192		As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?--
4193		O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
4194		Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
4195		Upon a rapier's point:--stay, Tybalt, stay!--
4196		Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

4214		Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
4215		The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:--
4216		Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
4217		Spare not for cost.
4218		
4219		Nurse.
4220		Go, you cot-quean, go,
4221		Get you to bed; faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
4222		For this night's watching.
4223		
4224		Capulet.
4225		No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
4226		All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
4227		
4228		Lady Capulet.
4229		Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
4230		But I will watch you from such watching now.
4231

4246		--Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
4247		Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

4251		And never trouble Peter for the matter.

4254

4256		Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
4257		Thou shalt be logger-head.--Good faith, 'tis day.
4258		The county will be here with music straight,
4259		For so he said he would:--I hear him near.

4280		Why, love, I say!--madam! sweetheart!--why, bride!--
4281		What, not a word?--you take your pennyworths now;
4282		Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
4283		The County Paris hath set up his rest
4284		That you shall rest but little.--God forgive me!
4285		Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
4286		I needs must wake her.--Madam, madam, madam!--
4287		Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
4288		He'll fright you up, i' faith.--Will it not be?
4289		What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
4290		I must needs wake you.--lady! lady! lady!--
4291		Alas, alas!--Help, help! My lady's dead!--

4310		O me, O me!--my child, my only life!

4322		Lady Capulet
4323		Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
4324		
4325		Capulet.
4326		Ha! let me see her:--out alas! she's cold;
4327		Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
4328		Life and these lips have long been separated:
4329		Death lies on her like an untimely frost
4330		Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
4331		Accursed time! unfortunate old man!
4332		
4333		Nurse.
4334		O lamentable day!

4337		O woful time!
4338		
4339		Capulet.
4340		Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
4341		Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
4342		
4343		[Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris, with Musicians.]
4344		
4345		Friar.
4346		Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
4347		
4348		Capulet.
4349		Ready to go, but never to return:--
4350		O son, the night before thy wedding day
4351		Hath death lain with thy bride:--there she lies,
4352		Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
4353		Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;
4354		My daughter he hath wedded: I will die.
4355		And leave him all; life, living, all is death's.
4356		
4357		Paris.
4358		Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
4359		And doth it give me such a sight as this?
4360		
4361		Lady Capulet.
4362		Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
4363		Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
4364		In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
4365		But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
4366		But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
4367		And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
4368		
4369		Nurse.
4370		O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day!
4371		Most lamentable day, most woeful day
4372		That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
4373		O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
4374		Never was seen so black a day as this:
4375		O woeful day! O woeful day!
4376		
4377		Paris.
4378		Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
4379		Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
4380		By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!--
4381		O love! O life!--not life, but love in death!
4382		
4383		Capulet.
4384		Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!--
4385		Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
4386		To murder, murder our solemnity?--
4387		O child! O child!--my soul, and not my child!--
4388		Dead art thou, dead!--alack, my child is dead;
4389		And with my child my joys are buried!
4390		
4391		Friar.
4392		Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
4393		In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
4394		Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
4395		And all the better is it for the maid:
4396		Your part in her you could not keep from death;
4397		But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
4398		The most you sought was her promotion;
4399		For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd:
4400		And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
4401		Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
4402		O, in this love, you love your child so ill
4403		That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
4404		She's not well married that lives married long:
4405		But she's best married that dies married young.
4406		Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
4407		On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
4408		In all her best array bear her to church;
4409		For though fond nature bids us all lament,
4410		Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
4411		
4412		Capulet.
4413		All things that we ordained festival
4414		Turn from their office to black funeral:
4415		Our instruments to melancholy bells;
4416		Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
4417		Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
4418		Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
4419		And all things change them to the contrary.
4420		
4421		Friar.
4422		Sir, go you in,--and, madam, go with him;--
4423		And go, Sir Paris;--every one prepare
4424		To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
4425		The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;
4426		Move them no more by crossing their high will.
4427		
4428		[Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris, and Friar.]

4430		1 Musician.
4431		Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
4432		
4433		Nurse.
4434		Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up;
4435		For well you know this is a pitiful case.
4436		
4437		[Exit.]
4438		
4439		1 Musician.
4440		Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
4441		
4442		[Enter Peter.]
4443		
4444		Peter.
4445		Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease':
4446		O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
4447		
4448		1 Musician.
4449		Why 'Heart's ease'?
4450		
4451		Peter.
4452		O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
4453		full of woe': O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
4454		
4455		1 Musician.
4456		Not a dump we: 'tis no time to play now.
4457		
4458		Peter.
4459		You will not then?
4460		
4461		1 Musician.
4462		No.
4463		
4464		Peter.
4465		I will then give it you soundly.
4466		
4467		1 Musician.
4468		What will you give us?
4469		
4470		Peter.
4471		No money, on my faith; but the gleek,--I will give you the
4472		minstrel.
4473		
4474		1 Musician.
4475		Then will I give you the serving-creature.
4476		
4477		Peter.
4478		Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
4479		I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you, I'll fa you: do you note
4480		me?
4481		
4482		1 Musician.
4483		An you re us and fa us, you note us.
4484		
4485		2 Musician.
4486		Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
4487		
4488		Peter.
4489		Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an
4490		iron wit, and put up my iron dagger.--Answer me like men:
4491		
4492		    'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
4493		      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
4494		    Then music with her silver sound'--
4495		
4496		why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver sound'?--
4497		What say you, Simon Catling?
4498		
4499		1 Musician.
4500		Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
4501		
4502		Peter.
4503		Pretty!--What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
4504		
4505		2 Musician.
4506		I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.
4507		
4508		Peter.
4509		Pretty too!--What say you, James Soundpost?
4510		
4511		3 Musician.
4512		Faith, I know not what to say.
4513		
4514		Peter.
4515		O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say for you.
4516		It is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no
4517		gold for sounding:--
4518		
4519		    'Then music with her silver sound
4520		      With speedy help doth lend redress.'
4521

4525		What a pestilent knave is this same!

4529		mourners, and stay dinner.

4537		
4538		[Enter Romeo.]
4539		
4540		Romeo.
4541		If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,
4542		My dreams presage some joyful news at hand;
4543		My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
4544		And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
4545		Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
4546		I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,--
4547		Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!--
4548		And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips,
4549		That I reviv'd, and was an emperor.
4550		Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
4551		When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
4552		
4553		[Enter Balthasar.]
4554		
4555		News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar?
4556		Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
4557		How doth my lady? Is my father well?
4558		How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
4559		For nothing can be ill if she be well.
4560		
4561		Balthasar.
4562		Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
4563		Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
4564		And her immortal part with angels lives.
4565		I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
4566		And presently took post to tell it you:
4567		O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
4568		Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
4569		
4570		Romeo.
4571		Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!--
4572		Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
4573		And hire post-horses. I will hence to-night.
4574		
4575		Balthasar.
4576		I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
4577		Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
4578		Some misadventure.
4579		
4580		Romeo.
4581		Tush, thou art deceiv'd:
4582		Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
4583		Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
4584		
4585		Balthasar.
4586		No, my good lord.
4587		
4588		Romeo.
4589		No matter: get thee gone,
4590		And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
4591		
4592		[Exit Balthasar.]
4593		
4594		Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
4595		Let's see for means;--O mischief, thou art swift
4596		To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
4597		I do remember an apothecary,--
4598		And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
4599		In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
4600		Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
4601		Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
4602		And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
4603		An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
4604		Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
4605		A beggarly account of empty boxes,
4606		Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
4607		Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses,
4608		Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
4609		Noting this penury, to myself I said,
4610		An if a man did need a poison now,
4611		Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
4612		Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
4613		O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
4614		And this same needy man must sell it me.
4615		As I remember, this should be the house:
4616		Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.--
4617		What, ho! apothecary!
4618		
4619		[Enter Apothecary.]
4620		
4621		Apothecary.
4622		Who calls so loud?
4623		
4624		Romeo.
4625		Come hither, man.--I see that thou art poor;
4626		Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
4627		A dram of poison; such soon-speeding gear
4628		As will disperse itself through all the veins
4629		That the life-weary taker mall fall dead;
4630		And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
4631		As violently as hasty powder fir'd
4632		Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
4633		
4634		Apothecary.
4635		Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
4636		Is death to any he that utters them.
4637		
4638		Romeo.
4639		Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
4640		And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
4641		Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
4642		Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back,
4643		The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law:
4644		The world affords no law to make thee rich;
4645		Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
4646		
4647		Apothecary.
4648		My poverty, but not my will consents.
4649		
4650		Romeo.
4651		I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
4652		
4653		Apothecary.
4654		Put this in any liquid thing you will,
4655		And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
4656		Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight.
4657		
4658		Romeo.
4659		There is thy gold; worse poison to men's souls,
4660		Doing more murders in this loathsome world
4661		Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell:
4662		I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
4663		Farewell: buy food and get thyself in flesh.--
4664		Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
4665		To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
4666		
4667		[Exeunt.]
4668		
4669		
4670		Scene II. Friar Lawrence's Cell.
4671		
4672		[Enter Friar John.]
4673		
4674		Friar John.
4675		Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
4676		
4677		[Enter Friar Lawrence.]
4678		
4679		Friar Lawrence.
4680		This same should be the voice of Friar John.
4681		Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
4682		Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
4683		
4684		Friar John.
4685		Going to find a barefoot brother out,
4686		One of our order, to associate me,
4687		Here in this city visiting the sick,
4688		And finding him, the searchers of the town,
4689		Suspecting that we both were in a house
4690		Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
4691		Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
4692		So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
4693		
4694		Friar Lawrence.
4695		Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
4696		
4697		Friar John.
4698		I could not send it,--here it is again,--
4699		Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
4700		So fearful were they of infection.
4701		
4702		Friar Lawrence.
4703		Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
4704		The letter was not nice, but full of charge
4705		Of dear import; and the neglecting it
4706		May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
4707		Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
4708		Unto my cell.
4709		
4710		Friar John.
4711		Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
4712		
4713		[Exit.]
4714		
4715		Friar Lawrence.
4716		Now must I to the monument alone;
4717		Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake:
4718		She will beshrew me much that Romeo
4719		Hath had no notice of these accidents;
4720		But I will write again to Mantua,
4721		And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;--
4722		Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!
4723		
4724		[Exit.]

4730		[Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch.]
4731		
4732		Paris.
4733		Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof;--
4734		Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
4735		Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
4736		Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
4737		So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,--
4738		Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,--
4739		But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
4740		As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
4741		Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
4742		
4743		Page.
4744		[Aside.] I am almost afraid to stand alone
4745		Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
4746		
4747		[Retires.]
4748		
4749		Paris.
4750		Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew:
4751		  O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones!
4752		Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
4753		  Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
4754		The obsequies that I for thee will keep,
4755		Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
4756		
4757		[The Page whistles.]
4758		
4759		The boy gives warning something doth approach.
4760		What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
4761		To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
4762		What, with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
4763		
4764		[Retires.]
4765		
4766		[Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.]
4767		
4768		Romeo.
4769		Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
4770		Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
4771		See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
4772		Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,
4773		Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof
4774		And do not interrupt me in my course.
4775		Why I descend into this bed of death
4776		Is partly to behold my lady's face,
4777		But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
4778		A precious ring,--a ring that I must use
4779		In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:--
4780		But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
4781		In what I further shall intend to do,
4782		By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint,
4783		And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
4784		The time and my intents are savage-wild;
4785		More fierce and more inexorable far
4786		Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
4787		
4788		Balthasar.
4789		I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
4790		
4791		Romeo.
4792		So shalt thou show me friendship.--Take thou that:
4793		Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
4794		
4795		Balthasar.
4796		For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
4797		His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
4798		
4799		[Retires.]
4800		
4801		Romeo.
4802		Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
4803		Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
4804		Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
4805		
4806		[Breaking open the door of the monument.]
4807		
4808		And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
4809		
4810		Paris.
4811		This is that banish'd haughty Montague
4812		That murder'd my love's cousin,--with which grief,
4813		It is supposed, the fair creature died,--
4814		And here is come to do some villanous shame
4815		To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.--
4816		
4817		[Advances.]
4818		
4819		Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
4820		Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
4821		Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee;
4822		Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
4823		
4824		Romeo.
4825		I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.--
4826		Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
4827		Fly hence and leave me:--think upon these gone;
4828		Let them affright thee.--I beseech thee, youth,
4829		Put not another sin upon my head
4830		By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
4831		By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
4832		For I come hither arm'd against myself:
4833		Stay not, be gone;--live, and hereafter say,
4834		A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
4835		
4836		Paris.
4837		I do defy thy conjurations,
4838		And apprehend thee for a felon here.
4839		
4840		Romeo.
4841		Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
4842		
4843		[They fight.]
4844		
4845		Page.
4846		O lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
4847		
4848		[Exit.]
4849		
4850		Paris.
4851		O, I am slain! [Falls.] If thou be merciful,
4852		Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
4853		
4854		[Dies.]
4855		
4856		Romeo.
4857		In faith, I will.--Let me peruse this face:--
4858		Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!--
4859		What said my man, when my betossed soul
4860		Did not attend him as we rode? I think
4861		He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
4862		Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
4863		Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
4864		To think it was so?--O, give me thy hand,
4865		One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
4866		I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;--
4867		A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
4868		For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
4869		This vault a feasting presence full of light.
4870		Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
4871		
4872		[Laying Paris in the monument.]
4873		
4874		How oft when men are at the point of death
4875		Have they been merry! which their keepers call
4876		A lightning before death: O, how may I
4877		Call this a lightning?--O my love! my wife!
4878		Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
4879		Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
4880		Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
4881		Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
4882		And death's pale flag is not advanced there.--
4883		Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
4884		O, what more favour can I do to thee
4885		Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
4886		To sunder his that was thine enemy?
4887		Forgive me, cousin!--Ah, dear Juliet,
4888		Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
4889		That unsubstantial death is amorous;
4890		And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
4891		Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
4892		For fear of that I still will stay with thee,
4893		And never from this palace of dim night
4894		Depart again: here, here will I remain
4895		With worms that are thy chambermaids: O, here
4896		Will I set up my everlasting rest;
4897		And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
4898		From this world-wearied flesh.--Eyes, look your last!
4899		Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
4900		The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
4901		A dateless bargain to engrossing death!--
4902		Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
4903		Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
4904		The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
4905		Here's to my love! [Drinks.]--O true apothecary!
4906		Thy drugs are quick.--Thus with a kiss I die.
4907		
4908		[Dies.]
4909		
4910		[Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with
4911		a lantern, crow, and spade.]
4912		
4913		Friar.
4914		Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
4915		Have my old feet stumbled at graves!--Who's there?
4916		Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?
4917		
4918		Balthasar.
4919		Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
4920		
4921		Friar.
4922		Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
4923		What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
4924		To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
4925		It burneth in the Capels' monument.
4926		
4927		Balthasar.
4928		It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
4929		One that you love.
4930		
4931		Friar.
4932		Who is it?
4933		
4934		Balthasar.
4935		Romeo.
4936		
4937		Friar.
4938		How long hath he been there?
4939		
4940		Balthasar.
4941		Full half an hour.
4942		
4943		Friar.
4944		Go with me to the vault.
4945		
4946		Balthasar.
4947		I dare not, sir;
4948		My master knows not but I am gone hence;
4949		And fearfully did menace me with death
4950		If I did stay to look on his intents.
4951		
4952		Friar.
4953		Stay then; I'll go alone:--fear comes upon me;
4954		O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
4955		
4956		Balthasar.
4957		As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
4958		I dreamt my master and another fought,
4959		And that my master slew him.
4960		
4961		Friar.
4962		Romeo! [Advances.]
4963		Alack, alack! what blood is this which stains
4964		The stony entrance of this sepulchre?--
4965		What mean these masterless and gory swords
4966		To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
4967		
4968		[Enters the monument.]
4969		
4970		Romeo! O, pale!--Who else? what, Paris too?
4971		And steep'd in blood?--Ah, what an unkind hour
4972		Is guilty of this lamentable chance!--The lady stirs.
4973		
4974		[Juliet wakes and stirs.]
4975		
4976		Juliet.
4977		O comfortable friar! where is my lord?--
4978		I do remember well where I should be,
4979		And there I am:--where is my Romeo?
4980		
4981		[Noise within.]
4982		
4983		Friar.
4984		I hear some noise.--Lady, come from that nest
4985		Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
4986		A greater power than we can contradict
4987		Hath thwarted our intents:--come, come away!
4988		Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
4989		And Paris too:--come, I'll dispose of thee
4990		Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
4991		Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
4992		Come, go, good Juliet [noise within],--I dare no longer stay.
4993		
4994		Juliet.
4995		Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.--
4996		
4997		[Exit Friar Lawrence.]
4998		
4999		What's here? a cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
5000		Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:--
5001		O churl! drink all, and left no friendly drop
5002		To help me after?--I will kiss thy lips;
5003		Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
5004		To make me die with a restorative.
5005		
5006		[Kisses him.]
5007		
5008		Thy lips are warm!
5009		
5010		1 Watch.
5011		[Within.] Lead, boy:--which way?
5012		
5013		Juliet.
5014		Yea, noise?--Then I'll be brief.--O happy dagger!
5015		
5016		[Snatching Romeo's dagger.]
5017		
5018		This is thy sheath [stabs herself]; there rest, and let me die.
5019		
5020		[Falls on Romeo's body and dies.]
5021		
5022		[Enter Watch, with the Page of Paris.]
5023		
5024		Page.
5025		This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
5026		
5027		1 Watch.
5028		The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
5029		Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
5030		
5031		[Exeunt some of the Watch.]
5032		
5033		Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain;--
5034		And Juliet bleeding; warm, and newly dead,
5035		Who here hath lain this two days buried.--
5036		Go, tell the prince;--run to the Capulets,--
5037		Raise up the Montagues,--some others search:--
5038		
5039		[Exeunt others of the Watch.]
5040		
5041		We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
5042		But the true ground of all these piteous woes
5043		We cannot without circumstance descry.
5044		
5045		[Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar.]
5046		
5047		2 Watch.
5048		Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
5049		
5050		1 Watch.
5051		Hold him in safety till the prince come hither.
5052		
5053		[Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.]
5054		
5055		3 Watch.
5056		Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs, and weeps:
5057		We took this mattock and this spade from him
5058		As he was coming from this churchyard side.
5059		
5060		1 Watch.
5061		A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
5062		
5063		[Enter the Prince and Attendants.]
5064		
5065		Prince.
5066		What misadventure is so early up,
5067		That calls our person from our morning's rest?
5068		
5069		[Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, and others.]
5070		
5071		Capulet.
5072		What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
5073		
5074		Lady Capulet.
5075		The people in the street cry Romeo,
5076		Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
5077		With open outcry, toward our monument.
5078		
5079		Prince.
5080		What fear is this which startles in our ears?
5081		
5082		1 Watch.
5083		Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
5084		And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
5085		Warm and new kill'd.
5086		
5087		Prince.
5088		Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
5089		
5090		1 Watch.
5091		Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
5092		With instruments upon them fit to open
5093		These dead men's tombs.
5094		
5095		Capulet.
5096		O heaven!--O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
5097		This dagger hath mista'en,--for, lo, his house
5098		Is empty on the back of Montague,--
5099		And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
5100		
5101		Lady Capulet.
5102		O me! this sight of death is as a bell
5103		That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
5104		
5105		[Enter Montague and others.]
5106		
5107		Prince.
5108		Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
5109		To see thy son and heir more early down.
5110		
5111		Montague.
5112		Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
5113		Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
5114		What further woe conspires against mine age?
5115		
5116		Prince.
5117		Look, and thou shalt see.
5118		
5119		Montague.
5120		O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
5121		To press before thy father to a grave?
5122		
5123		Prince.
5124		Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
5125		Till we can clear these ambiguities,
5126		And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
5127		And then will I be general of your woes,
5128		And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
5129		And let mischance be slave to patience.--
5130		Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
5131		
5132		Friar.
5133		I am the greatest, able to do least,
5134		Yet most suspected, as the time and place
5135		Doth make against me, of this direful murder;
5136		And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
5137		Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
5138		
5139		Prince.
5140		Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
5141		
5142		Friar.
5143		I will be brief, for my short date of breath
5144		Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
5145		Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
5146		And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
5147		I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
5148		Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
5149		Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
5150		For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
5151		You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
5152		Betroth'd, and would have married her perforce,
5153		To County Paris:--then comes she to me,
5154		And with wild looks, bid me devise some means
5155		To rid her from this second marriage,
5156		Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
5157		Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,
5158		A sleeping potion; which so took effect
5159		As I intended, for it wrought on her
5160		The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo
5161		That he should hither come as this dire night,
5162		To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
5163		Being the time the potion's force should cease.
5164		But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
5165		Was stay'd by accident; and yesternight
5166		Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
5167		At the prefixed hour of her waking
5168		Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
5169		Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
5170		Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
5171		But when I came,--some minute ere the time
5172		Of her awaking,--here untimely lay
5173		The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
5174		She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
5175		And bear this work of heaven with patience:
5176		But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
5177		And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
5178		But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
5179		All this I know; and to the marriage
5180		Her nurse is privy: and if ought in this
5181		Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
5182		Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
5183		Unto the rigour of severest law.
5184		
5185		Prince.
5186		We still have known thee for a holy man.--
5187		Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
5188		
5189		Balthasar.
5190		I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
5191		And then in post he came from Mantua
5192		To this same place, to this same monument.
5193		This letter he early bid me give his father;
5194		And threaten'd me with death, going in the vault,
5195		If I departed not, and left him there.
5196		
5197		Prince.
5198		Give me the letter,--I will look on it.--
5199		Where is the county's page that rais'd the watch?--
5200		Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
5201		
5202		Boy.
5203		He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
5204		And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
5205		Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
5206		And by-and-by my master drew on him;
5207		And then I ran away to call the watch.
5208		
5209		Prince.
5210		This letter doth make good the friar's words,
5211		Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
5212		And here he writes that he did buy a poison
5213		Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
5214		Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.--
5215		Where be these enemies?--Capulet,--Montague,--
5216		See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
5217		That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
5218		And I, for winking at your discords too,
5219		Have lost a brace of kinsmen:--all are punish'd.
5220		
5221		Capulet.
5222		O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
5223		This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
5224		Can I demand.
5225		
5226		Montague.
5227		But I can give thee more:
5228		For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
5229		That while Verona by that name is known,
5230		There shall no figure at such rate be set
5231		As that of true and faithful Juliet.
5232		
5233		Capulet.
5234		As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
5235		Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
5236		
5237		Prince.
5238		A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
5239		  The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
5240		Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
5241		  Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
5242		For never was a story of more woe
5243		Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
5244		
5245		[Exeunt.]
5246		
5247
